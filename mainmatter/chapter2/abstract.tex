\section{Abstract}

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy among men worldwide.
Recurrently mutated in primary and metastatic prostate tumours, \emph{FOXA1} encodes a pioneer transcription factor involved in disease onset and progression through both androgen receptor-dependent and androgen receptor-independent mechanisms.
Despite its oncogenic properties however, the regulation of \emph{FOXA1} expression remains unknown.
Here, we identify a set of six \emph{cis}-regulatory elements in the \emph{FOXA1} regulatory plexus harboring somatic single-nucleotide variants in primary prostate tumours.
We find that deletion and repression of these \emph{cis}-regulatory elements significantly decreases \emph{FOXA1} expression and prostate cancer cell growth.
Six of the ten single-nucleotide variants mapping to \emph{FOXA1} regulatory plexus significantly alter the transactivation potential of \emph{cis}-regulatory elements by modulating the binding of transcription factors.
Collectively, our results identify \emph{cis}-regulatory elements within the \emph{FOXA1} plexus mutated in primary prostate tumours as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
