\section{Abstract}

\Glsentrylong{pca} is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy among men worldwide.
Recurrently mutated in primary and metastatic prostate tumours, \emph{FOXA1} encodes a pioneer \glsentrylong{tf} involved in disease onset and progression through both \glsentrylong{ar}-dependent and \gls{ar}-independent mechanisms.
Despite its oncogenic properties however, the regulation of \emph{FOXA1} expression remains unknown.
Here, we identify a set of six \glsentrylongpl{cre} in the \emph{FOXA1} regulatory plexus harboring somatic \glsentrylongpl{snv} in primary prostate tumours.
We find that deletion and repression of these \glsentrylongpl{cre} significantly decreases \emph{FOXA1} expression and \glsentrylong{pca} cell growth.
Six of the ten \glsentrylongpl{snv} mapping to \emph{FOXA1} regulatory plexus significantly alter the transactivation potential of \glsentrylongpl{cre} by modulating the binding of \glsentrylongpl{tf}.
Collectively, our results identify \glsentrylongpl{cre} within the \emph{FOXA1} plexus mutated in primary prostate tumours as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
