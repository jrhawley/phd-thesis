\section{Dissertation structure}

I begin with \Cref{chap:FOXA1} by exploring the \emph{cis}-regulatory landscape of \gls{pca} and delineating the \glspl{cre} of the prostate oncogene \emph{FOXA1}.
I demonstrate the essentiality of \emph{FOXA1} for prostate tumours, identify putative \glspl{cre} based on integration of multiomic datasets in \gls{pca} cell lines, and assess the functional impact of recurrent \gls{pca} \glspl{snv} on \emph{FOXA1} expression and \gls{tf} binding.

With the \emph{cis}-regulatory network of \emph{FOXA1} established in \gls{pca}, I attempt to construct the \emph{cis}-regulatory landscape genome-wide in \gls{pca} with \gls{3c} mapping in \Cref{chap:3D}.
Using Hi-C, I characterize the three-dimensional chromatin organization of \gls{pca} and investigate the relationship between chromatin organization, \glspl{sv}, and the hijacking of \emph{cis}-regulatory networks more generally.

In assessing the impact of \glspl{sv} on chromatin organization, I uncovered a statistical problem stemming from the lack of recurrent \glspl{sv} across \gls{pca} patients, leading to unbalanced experimental comparisons.
To address this problem, I developed a statistical method for reducing error in gene expression fold-change estimates from unbalanced experimental designs in \Cref{chap:JS} and characterize the method.

Given the shared importance of mutations to \glspl{tf} and epigenetic enzymes in prostate cancer and leukemias, in \Cref{chap:BALL} I explore the epigenetic landscape of \gls{ball} and its relapse after treatment.
I characterize molecular changes to \gls{ball} tumours over the course of disease relapse and identify important changes to \gls{dname} that indicate the reversion to a stem-like phenotype, often present in a subpopulation of cells at diagnosis.
