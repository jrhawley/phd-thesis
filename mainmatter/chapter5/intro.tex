\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Relapse of \gls{ball} is common in both pediatric and adult patients
  \item Previous investigation of the origins of \gls{ball} relapse identifies growth of subclones present at diagnosis as critical factor
  \item Importance of \gls{dname}, CTCF binding, and chromatin organization in \glspl{hspc} function raises the possibility of these roles being important in \gls{ball} as well
  \item Previous work has identified stem-associated phenotypes and chromatin remodelling pathways as important in these subclones
  \item Here, we use patient matched diagnosis and relapse samples and multiple PDXs to investigate epigenetic dynamics that occur over \gls{ball} relapse
\end{enumerate}
