\section{Abstract}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Relapse of \gls{ball} is common in both pediatric and adult patients
  \item Previous investigation of the origins of \gls{ball} relapse identifies growth of subclones present at diagnosis as critical factor
  \item Here, we use patient matched diagnosis and relapse samples and multiple PDXs to investigate epigenetic dynamics that occur over \gls{ball} relapse
  \item Find most \glspl{dmr} are unique to each patient and are not recurrent
  \item The few recurrent \glspl{dmr} occur in the promoter regions of genes associated with differentiation and stem cell characteristics
  \item Suggests that relapse selects for clones with stem cell characteristics, both genetically and epigenetically
\end{enumerate}
