\section{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item summary of our work
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Relapse is a major barrier to treating \gls{ball}
    \item Requires rigorous molecular and multi-omic investigation to understand the origins of relapse and whether it can be predicted at diagnosis
    \item Multi-omic studies here identify \gls{dname} as an important biomarker of \gls{ball} relapse
    \item \gls{dname} and \gls{rnaseq} changes indicate presence of stem-like cells at diagnosis that become dominant at relapse
  \end{enumerate}
  \item context of current work in regard to relapse treatment and other studies
  \item future directions for investigation
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item effect of targeted \gls{dname} of promoter regions for important stem genes on engraftment
    \item effect of demethylating agents on relapsed \gls{ball} patients
    \item combination therapy of demethylating agents with chemotherapy to reduce the potential outgrowth of relapse-fated subclones
  \end{enumerate}
