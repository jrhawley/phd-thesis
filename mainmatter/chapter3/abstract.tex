\section{Abstract}

Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose progression is linked to genome instability.
However the impact of this instability on the three-dimensional chromatin organization and how this drives progression is unclear.
Using primary benign and tumour tissue, we find a high concordance in the higher-order three-dimensional genome organization across normal and \glsentrylong{pca} cells.
This concordance argues for constraints to the topology of prostate tumour genomes.
Nonetheless, we identify changes to focal chromatin interactions and show how \glspl{sv} can induce these changes to guide \glsentrylong{cre} hijacking.
Such events result in opposing differential expression on genes found at antipodes of rearrangements.
Collectively, our results argue that \glsentrylong{cre} hijacking from \gls{sv}-induced altered focal chromatin interactions overshadows higher-order topological changes in the development of primary \glsentrylong{pca}.
