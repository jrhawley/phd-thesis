\section{Abstract}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Differential analysis in \gls{rnaseq} experiments requires controlling biological and technical sources of noise
  \item Good experimental designs make this work easier, but are not always possible
  \item Controlling variance and sources of bias in experiments with a single treatment condition can yield uncertain results
  \item To combat this uncertainty, we introduce a new statistical method for these suboptimal experiment designs using the \glsentrylong{js} estimator for a normal distribution
  \item We compare it to the \gls{ols} estimator and find a 7-23 \% error reduction in fold change estimates
  \item We propose that this approach to reducing noise in differential expression analysis can be useful in single-cell analyses and studying rare diseases.
\end{enumerate}
