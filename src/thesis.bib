  abstract = {Most existing coverage-based (epi)genomic datasets are one-dimensional, but newer technologies probing interactions (physical, genetic, etc.) produce quantitative maps with two-dimensional genomic coordinate systems. Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium.Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be installed from the Python package index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of 333 primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular taxonomy in which 74\% of these tumors fell into one of seven subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV1/4, and FLI1) or mutations (SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1). Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25\% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19\%. Our analysis reveals molecular heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, as well as potentially actionable molecular defects.},

We performed an integrative characterization of epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, including single-cell RNA-seq, during normal human aging. Lineage-CD34+CD38- cells (HSC-enriched, HSCe) undergo age-associated epigenetic reprogramming consisting of redistribution of DNA methylation and reductions in H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. This reprogramming of aged HSCe globally targets developmental and cancer pathways which are comparably altered in AML of all ages; encompassing loss of 4,656 active enhancers, 3,091 bivalent promoters, and deregulation of several epigenetic modifiers and key hematopoietic transcription factors, such as KLF6, BCL6 and RUNX3. Notably, in vitro downregulation of KLF6 results in impaired differentiation, increased colony forming potential and changes in expression that recapitulate aging and leukemia signatures. Thus, age-associated epigenetic reprogramming may form a predisposing condition for the development of age-related AML.},

Here, we perform CRISPRi screens of 260 rCREs in PCa cell lines. We find that rCREs harboring high risk SNPs are more essential for cell proliferation and H3K27ac occupancy is a strong indicator of essentiality. We also show that cell-line-specific essential rCREs are enriched in the 8q24.21 region, with the rs11986220-containing rCRE regulating MYC and PVT1 expression, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a cell-line-specific manner, depending on DNA methylation-orchestrated occupancy of a CTCF binding site in between this rCRE and the MYC promoter. We demonstrate that CTCF deposition at this site as measured by DNA methylation level is highly variable in prostate specimens, and observe the MYC eQTL in the 8q24.21 locus in individuals with low CTCF binding. Together our findings highlight a causal mechanism synergistically driven by a risk SNP and DNA methylation-mediated 3D genome architecture, advocating for the integration of genetics and epigenetics in assessing risks conferred by genetic predispositions.},

Although the screening strategies for early detection have been shown to be successful in Japan and South Korea, they are either not implemented or not feasible in most of the world, leading to late diagnosis in most patients. Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to the development of many endemic GACs, and pre-emptive eradication or early treatment of this bacterial infection might provide effective primary prevention. GACs are phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous. Localized (clinical stage I) GAC is best treated either endoscopically or with limited surgical resection, but clinical stage II or stage III tumours require multidisciplinary adjunctive approaches in addition to surgery. Although GAC is highly treatable in its early stages, advanced (clinical stage IV) GAC has a median survival of just {$\sim$}9\textendash 10 months. However, detailed molecular and immune profiling of GAC is yielding promise; early studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors suggest that GAC is amenable to immune modulation. Molecular studies have yielded a vast quantity of new information for potential exploitation. Nevertheless, advances against GACs have lagged compared with other tumours of similar incidence, and more research is necessary to overcome the obstacles to prolong survival.},

Applying this method to primary human bone marrow specimens from patients with Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia (AML), we demonstrated that genetically distinct AML subtypes display diametrically opposed DNA methylation patterns. As compared to normal controls, we observed widespread hypermethylation in IDH mutant AMLs, preferentially targeting promoter regions and CpG islands neighboring the transcription start sites of genes. In contrast, AMLs harboring translocations affecting the MLL gene displayed extensive loss of methylation of an almost mutually exclusive set of CpGs, which instead affected introns and distal intergenic CpG islands and shores. When analyzed in conjunction with gene expression profiles, it became apparent that these specific patterns of DNA methylation result in differing roles in gene expression regulation. However, despite this subtype-specific DNA methylation patterning, a much smaller set of CpG sites are consistently affected in both AML subtypes. Most CpG sites in this common core of aberrantly methylated CpGs were hypermethylated in both AML subtypes. Therefore, aberrant DNA methylation patterns in AML do not occur in a stereotypical manner but rather are highly specific and associated with specific driving genetic lesions.},

Originally a laborious manual process, Bionano Genomics platforms now offer high-throughput, automated optical mapping based on chips packed with nanochannels through which unwound DNA is guided and the fluorescent DNA backbone and specific restriction sites are recorded. Although the raw image data obtained is of high quality, the processing and assembly software accompanying the platforms is closed source and does not seem to make full use of data, labeling approximately half of the measured signals as unusable. Here we introduce two new software tools, independent of Bionano Genomics software, to extract and process molecules from raw images (OptiScan) and to perform molecule-to-molecule and molecule-to-reference alignments using a novel signal-based approach (OptiMap). We demonstrate that the molecules detected by OptiScan can yield better assemblies, and that the approach taken by OptiMap results in higher use of molecules from the raw data. These tools lay the foundation for a suite of open-source methods to process and analyze high-throughput optical mapping data. The Python implementations of the OptiTools are publicly available through http://www.bif.wur.nl/.},

  abstract = {Somatic mutations in driver genes may ultimately lead to the development of cancer. Understanding how somatic mutations accumulate in cancer genomes and the underlying factors that generate somatic mutations is therefore crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies. To understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific mutational processes, we studied 3,000 tumor\textendash normal-pair whole-genome datasets from 42 different human cancer types. Our analyses reveal that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries. Domain boundaries constitute a better proxy to track mutational load change than replication timing measurements. We show that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions where certain processes generate mutations in active domains, and others generate mutations in inactive domains. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation-rate variations observed in human cancers.},

Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes will be proportional to the chronological age of the person. Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes operating in human somatic cells.},

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

To illustrate MCC-Seq, we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on adipose tissue (AT) samples and public databases to design AT-specific panels. We establish its efficiency for high-density interrogation of methylome variability by systematic comparisons with other approaches and demonstrate its applicability by identifying novel methylation variation within enhancers strongly correlated to plasma triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol, including at CD36. Our more comprehensive AT panel assesses tissue methylation and genotypes in parallel at {$\sim$}4 and {$\sim$}3 M sites, respectively. Our study demonstrates that MCC-Seq provides comparable accuracy to alternative approaches but enables more efficient cataloguing of functional and disease-relevant epigenetic and genetic variants for large-scale EWAS.},

However, approaches for the transcriptional modulation of many genes simultaneously in a predictive manner are lacking. Here, through the combination of simulations, systems modelling and in vitro experiments, we provide a physical regulatory framework based on chromatin packing-density heterogeneity for modulating the genomic information space. Because transcriptional interactions are essentially chemical reactions, they depend largely on the local physical nanoenvironment. We show that the regulation of the chromatin nanoenvironment allows for the predictable modulation of global patterns in gene expression. In particular, we show that the rational modulation of chromatin density fluctuations can lead to a decrease in global transcriptional activity and intercellular transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer cells during chemotherapeutic responses to achieve near-complete cancer cell killing in vitro. Our findings represent a `macrogenomic engineering' approach to modulating the physical structure of chromatin for whole-scale transcriptional modulation. A model accounting for the properties of the local chromatin environment predicts the modulation of patterns in gene expression and helps screen for chemotherapeutic adjuvants that lead to an enhanced therapeutic response in cancer cells.},

An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an unknown cell based on its transcriptional profile; and clearly, the ability to accurately predict a cell type and any pathologic-related state will play a critical role in the early diagnosis of disease and decisions around the personalized treatment for patients. Here we present a new generalizable method (             scPred             ) for prediction of cell type(s), using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning classification.             scPred             solves several problems associated with the identification of individual gene feature selection, and is able to capture subtle effects of many genes, increasing the overall variance explained by the model, and correspondingly improving the prediction accuracy. We validate the performance of             scPred             by performing experiments to classify tumor versus non-tumor epithelial cells in gastric cancer, then using independent molecular techniques (cyclic immunohistochemistry) to confirm our prediction, achieving an accuracy of classifying the disease state of individual cells of 99\%. Moreover, we apply             scPred             to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells, and show that             scPred             is able to classify cell subtypes with an accuracy of 96.1-99.2\%. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of             scPred             as a single cell prediction method that can be used for a wide variety of applications. The generalized method is implemented in software available here:             https://github.com/IMB-Computational-Genomics-Lab/scPred/},

  abstract = {Deep learning using neural networks relies on a class of machine-learnable models constructed using `differentiable programs'. These programs can combine mathematical equations specific to a particular domain of natural science with general-purpose, machine-learnable components trained on experimental data. Such programs are having a growing impact on molecular and cellular biology. In this Perspective, we describe an emerging `differentiable biology' in which phenomena ranging from the small and specific (for example, one experimental assay) to the broad and complex (for example, protein folding) can be modeled effectively and efficiently, often by exploiting knowledge about basic natural phenomena to overcome the limitations of sparse, incomplete and noisy data. By distilling differentiable biology into a small set of conceptual primitives and illustrative vignettes, we show how it can help to address long-standing challenges in integrating multimodal data from diverse experiments across biological scales. This promises to benefit fields as diverse as biophysics and functional genomics. This Perspective describes advances in computer science that enable the integration of deep learning with traditional knowledge-based modeling in biological sciences, and discusses how such integration might overcome the challenges of modeling sparse, incomplete and noisy experimental data.},

However, accurate inference of aberrant protein activity in biological samples is still challenging as genetic alterations are only partially predictive and direct measurements of protein activity are generally not feasible. To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.},

There have been no systematic attempts to explore and utilise epiallelic variation, and so extend the range of phenotypes available for selection in crop improvement. We developed an approach for generating novel epialleles by perturbation of the DNA methylation status. 5- Azacytidine (5-AzaC) provides selective targeting of 5mCG, which in plants is associated with exonic DNA. Targeted chemical intervention using 5-AzaC has advantages over transgenic or mutant modulation of methyltransferases, allowing stochastic generation of epialleles across the genome.},

  abstract = {Typically, RRBS samples are generated by digesting genomic DNA with the restriction endonuclease MspI. This is followed by end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation and finally bisulfite conversion. Often, the library is also size-selected for fragments between 40 and 220bp in length. This fragment size has been shown to be plentiful in the sample and yield information on the vast majority of CpG islands (CGIs) in the human or mouse genome. Fig. 1 shows that quite a few MspI-MspI fragments (generated in silico for the mouse genome) are even shorter than 40bp. Since the size selection process if not as good as it is in theory, often a sizeable number of fragments below 40bp can end up in the RRBS library. The fairly small fragment size of RRBS fragments can become a potential problem especially for sequencing reads with high read length (e.g. {$>$} 75bp or {$>$}100bp). If the read length is longer than the MspI-MspI fragment itself, the sequencing read may continue to read into the adapter sequence on the 3' end: Such 'adapter contamination' may result in a lower mapping efficiency if the read does not align at all, or it may lead to false alignments which can result in incorrect methylation calls. As a simple rule, the longer the read length the higher the proportion of reads with adapter contamination. If such adapter contamination is not spotted and removed appropriately, a longer read length is most likely resulting in a lower mapping efficiency! If the read length is longer than the MspI fragment one will also read (and perform a methylation call) for a cytosine that has been filled in with a predefined methylation state during the end-repair step. This is discussed further below.},

It is important that the observed methylation patterns are representative of those in the cell population. However, bisulfite sequencing may introduce new patterns and degradation may eliminate rare patterns. We investigate how bisulfite degradation may be expected to affect the data, and how inference could be made in light of this.

Experiments in sorted populations of cells have also linked tran-scriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity by demonstrating dif-ferences in DNA methylation between transcriptional states, such as gains in DNA methylation in NANOG lo and REX1 lo (REX1 is also known as ZFP42) cells compared with, respectively, NANOG hi and REX1 hi cells 11,16 . The development of single-cell techniques has allowed the transcriptional heterogeneity of ESCs to be studied in unprecedented detail, revealing a complex population structure and multiple sources of variation 17,18 . Using scBS-seq, we have also demonstrated DNA-methylation heterogeneity in ESCs at the single-cell level 3 . To further inves-tigate the link between epigenetic and transcriptional hetero-geneity in ESCs, we performed scM\&T-seq on 76 individual serum ESCs and 16 ESCs grown in '2i' media, which induces genome-wide DNA hypomethylation 16 . We obtained an average of 2.7 million scRNA-seq reads per cell, and we excluded cells with fewer than 2 million mapped reads (Supplementary Table 1). We have previously shown that the scRNA-seq data generated by the G\&T-seq method is of similar quality to that generated using the scRNA-seq protocol (Smart-seq2) alone 7 . In ESCs that met scRNA-seq quality-control criteria, we detected transcripts from between 4,000 and 8,000 genes exceeding one transcript per million, consistent with previ-ous measurements made using the method (additional scRNA-seq quality metrics are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). To assess the quality of the scBS-seq data, we compared the result-ing single-cell methylomes with published data from 20 serum and 12 2i ESCs for which stand-alone scBS-seq was performed 3 . Sequencing of the scBS-seq libraries was performed at relatively low depth (an average of 11.1 million reads), with an average of 3.15 million genomic reads mapped per cell (Supplementary Table 1). We excluded cells with a mapping efficiency of {$<$}7\% or a bisulfite-conversion efficiency of {$<$}95\% (as estimated by non-CpG methylation). Cells passing these quality-control steps had a mean mapping efficiency of 15.6\% (compared to a mean of 17.2\% for single ESCs with stand-alone scBS-seq 3 ; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). The low mappability was not due to foreign DNA, as negative controls showed less than 2\% align-ment, but it can be explained by high primer contamination (Supplementary Fig. 3). Because of the decreased sequencing depth, methylome coverage in scM\&T-seq libraries was lower than that in scBS-seq libraries. However, genome-wide CpG coverage at matched sequencing depth We report scm\&t-seq, a method for parallel single-cell genome-wide methylome and transcriptome sequencing that allows for the discovery of associations between transcriptional and epigenetic variation. Profiling of 61 mouse embryonic stem cells confirmed known links between dna methylation and transcription. notably, the method revealed previously unrecognized associations between heterogeneously methylated distal regulatory elements and transcription of key pluripotency genes.},

Maps of high frequency interactions between different segments of chromatin have revealed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), within which most of the regulatory interactions are thought to occur. Recent studies have shown that TADs are not homogeneous structural units, but rather they appear to be organized into a hierarchy. However, precise identification of hierarchical TAD structures remains a challenge. We present OnTAD, an Optimized Nested TAD caller from Hi-C data, to identify hierarchical TADs. Compared to existing methods, OnTAD has significantly improved accuracy and running speed. Results from OnTAD reveal new biological insights on the role of different TAD levels, boundary usage in gene regulation, the loop extrusion model, and compartmental domains.

We sequenced the untranslated regions (UTRs) of 72 established driver genes in 428 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and identified FOXA1 3{${'}$}-UTR mutations in 12\% of patients. The mutations were predominantly insertions or deletions, covered the entire UTR without motif enrichment, and were not detected in other cancers. FOXA1 lies in head-on orientation with the androgen-regulated non-coding gene AL121790.1, resulting in strong prostate lineage-specific bidirectional transcription across the FOXA1 3{${'}$}-UTR. This suggests transcriptional activity as a cause for the localized hypermutation. The indel-dominant pattern of somatic mutation extends into the FOXA1 coding region, where it is shaped by clonal selection to yield a cluster of non-frameshift indels inside the forkhead domain. Somatic FOXA1 3{${'}$}-UTR mutations may prove useful for diagnostic and screening approaches, given their high frequency and lineage specificity.},

The breadth of cell-lines covered by the ENCODE datasets allows us to accomplish this in a systematic manner. We also explore the relationship of these empirical signal artifact regions to sequence mappability and known repeat annotations. The complete list of regions and comparisons to repeat annotations can be found in this google spreadsheet . It is important to note that RNA based sequencing experiments were not used to identify these artifact regions and it is unclear how these regions affect mapping and quantification in RNA-seq experiments.},

To address this, we developed `single-cell split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension' (scSPRITE). scSPRITE uses split-and-pool barcoding to tag DNA fragments in the same nucleus and their 3D spatial arrangement. Because scSPRITE measures multiway DNA contacts, it generates higher-resolution maps within an individual cell than can be achieved by proximity ligation. We applied scSPRITE to thousands of mouse embryonic stem cells and detected known genome structures, including chromosome territories, active and inactive compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs) as well as long-range inter-chromosomal structures organized around various nuclear bodies. We observe that these structures exhibit different levels of heterogeneity across the population, with TADs representing dynamic units of genome organization across cells. We expect that scSPRITE will be a critical tool for studying genome structure within heterogeneous populations.},

  abstract = {It's a dog's life Canine transmissible venereal tumor is one of the few cancer lineages that is transferred among individuals through contact. It arose millennia ago and has been evolving independently from its hosts ever since. Baez-Ortega et al. looked at the phylogenetic history of the cancer and describe several distinctive mutational patterns (see the Perspective by Maley and Shibata). Most notably, both positive and negative selection show only weak or distant signals. This suggests that the main driver of the lineage's evolution is neutral genetic drift. Understanding the influence of drift may reshape how we think about long-term cancer evolution. Science, this issue p. eaau9923; see also p. 440 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a sexually transmitted cancer that manifests as genital tumors in dogs. This cancer first arose in an individual ``founder dog'' several thousand years ago and has since survived by transfer of living cancer cells to new hosts during coitus. Today, CTVT affects dogs around the world and is the oldest and most prolific known cancer lineage. CTVT thus provides an opportunity to explore the evolution of cancer over the long term and to track the unusual biological transition from multicellular organism to obligate conspecific asexual parasite. Furthermore, the CTVT genome, acting as a living biomarker, has recorded the changing mutagenic environments experienced by this cancer throughout millennia and across continents. RATIONALETo capture the genetic diversity of the CTVT lineage, we analyzed somatic mutations extracted from the protein-coding genomes (exomes) of 546 globally distributed CTVT tumors. We inferred a time-resolved phylogenetic tree for the clone and used this to trace the worldwide spread of the disease and to select subsets of mutations acquired at known geographical locations and time periods. Computational methods were applied to extract mutational signatures and to measure their exposures across time and space. In addition, we assessed the activity of selection using ratios of nonsynonymous and synonymous variants. RESULTSThe CTVT phylogeny reveals that the lineage first arose from its founder dog 4000 to 8500 years ago, likely in Asia, with the most recent common ancestor of modern globally distributed tumors occurring \textasciitilde 1900 years ago. CTVT underwent a rapid global expansion within the past 500 years, likely aided by intensification of human maritime travel. We identify a highly specific mutational signature dominated by C{$>$}T mutations at GTCCA pentanucleotide contexts, which operated in CTVT up until \textasciitilde 1000 years ago. The number of mutations caused by ultraviolet light exposure is correlated with latitude of tumor collection, and we identify CTVTs with heritable hyperactivity of an endogenous mutational process. Several ``driver'' mutation candidates are identified in the basal trunk of the CTVT tree, but there is little evidence for ongoing positive selection. Although negative selection is detectable, its effect is largely confined to genes with known essential functions, thus implying that CTVT predominantly evolves through neutral processes. CONCLUSIONWe have traced the evolution of a transmissible cancer over several thousand years, tracking its spread across continents and contrasting the mutational processes and selective forces that molded its genome with those described in human cancers. The identification of a highly context-specific mutational process that operated in the past but subsequently vanished, as well as correlation of ultraviolet light\textendash induced DNA damage with latitude, highlight the potential for long-lived, widespread clonal organisms to act as biomarkers for mutagenic exposures. Our results suggest that neutral genetic drift is the dominant evolutionary force operating on cancer over the long term, in contrast to the ongoing positive selection that is often observed in short-lived human cancers. The weakness of negative selection in this asexual lineage may be expected to lead to the progressive accumulation of deleterious mutations, invoking Muller's ratchet and raising the possibility that CTVT may be declining in fitness despite its global success. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6452/eaau9923/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Cancer evolution over thousands of years.The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is an ancient contagious cancer with a global distribution. We sequenced the exomes of 546 CTVT tumors and identified somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). These were used to construct a time-resolved phylogenetic tree, yielding insights into the cancer's phylogeography, mutational processes, and signatures of selection across thousands of years. Notably, a highly context-specific mutational pattern named signature A was identified, which was active in the past but ceased to operate about 1000 years ago. BP, years before present. The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a cancer lineage that arose several millennia ago and survives by ``metastasizing'' between hosts through cell transfer. The somatic mutations in this cancer record its phylogeography and evolutionary history. We constructed a time-resolved phylogeny from 546 CTVT exomes and describe the lineage's worldwide expansion. Examining variation in mutational exposure, we identify a highly context-specific mutational process that operated early in the cancer's evolution but subsequently vanished, correlate ultraviolet-light mutagenesis with tumor latitude, and describe tumors with heritable hyperactivity of an endogenous mutational process. CTVT displays little evidence of ongoing positive selection, and negative selection is detectable only in essential genes. We illustrate how long-lived clonal organisms capture changing mutagenic environments, and reveal that neutral genetic drift is the dominant feature of long-term cancer evolution. Canine venereal tumor evolution was largely driven by genetic drift. Canine venereal tumor evolution was largely driven by genetic drift.},

  abstract = {The ten-eleven-translocation-2 (TET2) gene is a novel tumor suppressor gene involved in several hematological malignancies of myeloid and lymphoid origin. Besides loss-of-function mutations and deletions, hypermethylation of the CpG island at the TET2 promoter has been found in human cancers. The TET2 encoded protein regulates DNA methylation. The present study aimed to examine DNA promoter methylation of TET2 in 100 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 120 healthy children in southeast Iran. In addition, mRNA expression levels were assessed in 30 new cases of ALL and 32 controls. Our findings indicated that promoter methylation of TET2 significantly increases the risk of ALL (OR=2.60, 95\% CI=1.31-5.12, p=0.0060) in comparison with absent methylation. Furthermore, the TET2 gene was significantly downregulated in childhood ALL compared to healthy children (p=0.0235). The results revealed that hypermethylation and downregulation of TET2 gene may play a role in predisposition to childhood ALL. Further studies with larger sample sizes and different ethnicities are needed to confirm our findings.},

  abstract = {Sustained expression of the estrogen receptor-{$\alpha$} (ESR1) drives two-thirds of breast cancer and defines the ESR1-positive subtype. ESR1 engages enhancers upon estrogen stimulation to establish an oncogenic expression program. Somatic copy number alterations involving the ESR1 gene occur in approximately 1\% of ESR1-positive breast cancers, suggesting that other mechanisms underlie the persistent expression of ESR1. We report significant enrichment of somatic mutations within the set of regulatory elements (SRE) regulating ESR1 in 7\% of ESR1-positive breast cancers. These mutations regulate ESR1 expression by modulating transcription factor binding to the DNA. The SRE includes a recurrently mutated enhancer whose activity is also affected by rs9383590, a functional inherited single-nucleotide variant (SNV) that accounts for several breast cancer risk-associated loci. Our work highlights the importance of considering the combinatorial activity of regulatory elements as a single unit to delineate the impact of noncoding genetic alterations on single genes in cancer.},

To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard methodology. Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. Each step in the workflow is described in detail in the following sections.},

BIRC3 mutations (2.5\%) were associated with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), del(11q) and trisomy 12, whereas MYD88 mutations (2.2\%) were exclusively found among M-CLL. NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 exhibited variable frequencies and were mostly enriched within clinically aggressive cases. Interestingly, as the timespan between diagnosis and mutational screening increased, so too did the incidence of SF3B1 mutations; no such increase was observed for NOTCH1 mutations. Regarding the clinical impact, NOTCH1 mutations, SF3B1 mutations and TP53 aberrations (deletion/mutation, TP53ab) correlated with shorter time-to-first-treatment (P{$<$}0.0001) in 889 treatment-naive Binet stage A cases. In multivariate analysis (n=774), SF3B1 mutations and TP53ab along with del(11q) and U-CLL, but not NOTCH1 mutations, retained independent significance. Importantly, TP53ab and SF3B1 mutations had an adverse impact even in U-CLL. In conclusion, we support the clinical relevance of novel recurrent mutations in CLL, highlighting the adverse impact of SF3B1 and TP53 mutations, even independent of IGHV mutational status, thus underscoring the need for urgent standardization/harmonization of the detection methods.},

This unbiased choice of targets takes advantage of existing expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation data and enabled us to observe a pattern of low promoter methylation and high gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes. The second method, methyl-sensitive cut counting, generated nontargeted genome-scale data for approximately 1.4 million HpaII sites in the DNA of B-lymphocytes and confirmed that gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes is a consistent phenomenon throughout the human genome. Our observations highlight the usefulness of techniques that are not inherently or intentionally biased towards particular subsets like CpG islands or promoter regions.},

However, the way p53 selectively binds its cognate sites in different types of cells is not fully understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 25 published p53 cistromes and identified 3,551 and 6,039 high-confidence binding sites in normal and cancer cells, respectively. Our analysis revealed two distinct epigenetic features underlying p53-DNA interactions in vivo. First, p53 binding sites are associated with transcriptionally active histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) in normal-cell chromatin, but with repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) in cancer-cell chromatin. Second, p53 binding sites in cancer cells are characterized by a lower level of DNA methylation than their counterparts in normal cells, probably related to global hypomethylation in cancers. Intriguingly, regardless of the cell type, p53 sites are highly enriched in the endogenous retroviral elements of the ERV1 family, highlighting the importance of this repeat family in shaping the transcriptional network of p53. Moreover, the p53 sites exhibit an unusual combination of chromatin patterns: high nucleosome occupancy and, at the same time, high sensitivity to DNase I. Our results suggest that p53 can access its target sites in a chromatin environment that is non-permissive to most DNA-binding transcription factors, which may allow p53 to act as a pioneer transcription factor in the context of chromatin.},

There it targets evolutionarily young transposons, of which there is a heavy burden in the mouse genome. DNMT3C methylates and silences the young transposons, preserving male fertility. Science, this issue p. 909 DNA methylation is prevalent in mammalian genomes and plays a central role in the epigenetic control of development. The mammalian DNA methylation machinery is thought to be composed of three DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) and one cofactor (DNMT3L). Here, we describe the discovery of Dnmt3C, a de novo DNA methyltransferase gene that evolved via a duplication of Dnmt3B in rodent genomes and was previously annotated as a pseudogene. We show that DNMT3C is the enzyme responsible for methylating the promoters of evolutionarily young retrotransposons in the male germ line and that this specialized activity is required for mouse fertility. DNMT3C reveals the plasticity of the mammalian DNA methylation system and expands the scope of the mechanisms involved in the epigenetic control of retrotransposons.

It is increasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along the genome -- so-called `epialleles' -- offers greater insight into epigenetic dynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm marks individually. Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are present in multiple regions of the same tumour. We apply our method to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from multiple regions of one lung cancer tumour and a matched normal sample. The model borrows information from all tumour regions to leverage greater statistical power. The total number of epialleles, the epiallele DNAm patterns, and a noise hyperparameter are all automatically inferred from the data. Uncertainty as to which epiallele an observed sequencing read originated from is explicitly incorporated by marginalising over the appropriate posterior densities. The degree to which tumour samples are contaminated with normal tissue can be estimated and corrected for. By tracing the distribution of epialleles throughout the tumour we can infer the phylogenetic history of the tumour, identify epialleles that differ between normal and cancer tissue, and define a measure of global epigenetic disorder.},

These agents, along with inhibitors of histone deacetylation, have shown clinical activity in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies where gene hypermethylation occurs. This review examines alteration in DNA methylation in cancer, effects on gene expression, and implications for the use of hypomethylating agents in the treatment of cancer.},

These changes involve DNA methylation, histone modifiers and readers, chromatin remodelers, microRNAs, and other components of chromatin. Cancer genetics and epigenetics are inextricably linked in generating the malignant phenotype; epigenetic changes can cause mutations in genes, and, conversely, mutations are frequently observed in genes that modify the epigenome. Epigenetic therapies, in which the goal is to reverse these changes, are now one standard of care for a preleukemic disorder and form of lymphoma. The application of epigenetic therapies in the treatment of solid tumors is also emerging as a viable therapeutic route.},

Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters.

MCC pathogenesis is associated with either the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus or chronic exposure to ultraviolet light (UV), which can cause a characteristic pattern of multiple DNA mutations. Notably, in the Northern hemisphere, the majority of MCC cases are of viral aetiology; by contrast, in areas with high UV exposure, UV-mediated carcinogenesis is predominant. The two aetiologies share similar clinical, histopathological and prognostic characteristics. MCC presents with a solitary cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule, most frequently in sun-exposed areas. In fact, UV exposure is probably involved in both viral-mediated and non-viral-mediated carcinogenesis, by contributing to immunosuppression or DNA damage, respectively. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on analyses of histological features and immunological marker expression profiles of the lesion. At primary diagnosis, loco-regional metastases are already present in {$\sim$}30\% of patients. Excision of the tumour is the first-line therapy; if not feasible, radiotherapy can often effectively control the disease. Chemotherapy was the only alternative in advanced-stage or refractory MCC until several clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.},

Here, we analyze the reference epigenome of seven primary CLLs and the regulatory chromatin landscape of 107 primary cases in the context of normal B cell differentiation. We identify that the CLL chromatin landscape is largely influenced by distinct dynamics during normal B cell maturation. Beyond this, we define extensive catalogues of regulatory elements de novo reprogrammed in CLL as a whole and in its major clinico-biological subtypes classified by IGHV somatic hypermutation levels. We uncover that IGHV-unmutated CLLs harbor more active and open chromatin than IGHV-mutated cases. Furthermore, we show that de novo active regions in CLL are enriched for NFAT, FOX and TCF/LEF transcription factor family binding sites. Although most genetic alterations are not associated with consistent epigenetic profiles, CLLs with MYD88 mutations and trisomy 12 show distinct chromatin configurations. Furthermore, we observe that non-coding mutations in IGHV-mutated CLLs are enriched in H3K27ac-associated regulatory elements outside accessible chromatin. Overall, this study provides an integrative portrait of the CLL epigenome, identifies extensive networks of altered regulatory elements and sheds light on the relationship between the genetic and epigenetic architecture of the disease.},

Through the interaction with fundamental transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, fusion oncogenes and by modulating core members of signaling pathways, it can affect leukemic cells biology.

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

Patients participated in either part of the study or in both parts sequentially. In the initial part, decitabine was administered intravenously at doses of 10\textendash 120 mg/m2 per d for 5 d every other week in cycles of 28 d. In the combination part, patients were treated on the first 5 d of Hyper-CVAD with intravenous decitabine at 5\textendash 60 mg/m2 per d. A total of 39 patients received treatment in the study: 14 in the first part only, 16 sequentially in both parts and 9 in the second part only. Decitabine was tolerated at all doses administered, and grade 3 or 4 toxic effects included non-life-threatening hepatotoxicity and hyperglycaemia. Induction of DNA hypomethylation was observed at doses of decitabine up to 80 mg/m2. Some patients who had previously progressed on Hyper-CVAD alone achieved a complete response when decitabine was added. Decitabine alone or given with Hyper-CVAD is safe and has clinical activity in patients with advanced ALL.},

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell's position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. However, the full range of prostate cancer genomic alterations is incompletely characterized. Here we present the complete sequence of seven primary human prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts. Several tumours contained complex chains of balanced (that is, `copy-neutral') rearrangements that occurred within or adjacent to known cancer genes. Rearrangement breakpoints were enriched near open chromatin, androgen receptor and ERG DNA binding sites in the setting of the ETS gene fusion TMPRSS2\textendash ERG, but inversely correlated with these regions in tumours lacking ETS fusions. This observation suggests a link between chromatin or transcriptional regulation and the genesis of genomic aberrations. Three tumours contained rearrangements that disrupted CADM2, and four harboured events disrupting either PTEN (unbalanced events), a prostate tumour suppressor, or MAGI2 (balanced events), a PTEN interacting protein not previously implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Thus, genomic rearrangements may arise from transcriptional or chromatin aberrancies and engage prostate tumorigenic mechanisms.},

Whereas in animals this repressive mark for transcription is deposited on long regions of DNA, in plants its localization is gene-specific. Because of this and a well-annotated recent whole-genome duplication, Arabidopsis thaliana is uniquely suited for studying the potential association of H3K27me3 with the evolutionary fate of genes.},

This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed ``bivalent domains,'' consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

Both chromosomes show punctate sites enriched for modified histones. Sites showing trimethylation correlate with transcription starts, while those showing mainly dimethylation occur elsewhere in the vicinity of active genes. Punctate methylation patterns are also evident at the cytokine and IL-4 receptor loci. The Hox clusters present a strikingly different picture, with broad lysine 4-methylated regions that overlay multiple active genes. We suggest these regions represent active chromatin domains required for the maintenance of Hox gene expression. Methylation patterns at orthologous loci are strongly conserved between human and mouse even though many methylated sites do not show sequence conservation notably higher than background. This suggests that the DNA elements that direct the methylation represent only a small fraction of the region or lie at some distance from the site.},

Genes associated with complex regulatory landscapes generally exhibit high expression levels that remain evolutionarily stable. While the number of regulatory elements is the key driver of transcriptional output and resilience, regulatory conservation matters: elements active across mammals most effectively stabilise gene expression. In contrast, recently-evolved enhancers typically contribute weakly, consistent with their high evolutionary plasticity. These effects are observed across the entire mammalian clade and robust to potential confounders, such as gene expression level. Overall, our results illuminate how the evolutionary stability of gene expression is profoundly entwined with both the number and conservation of surrounding promoters and enhancers.},

Because DNA methylation can capture the regulatory state of tumors, we analyzed differential methylation patterns genome-wide among benign prostatic tissue and low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer and found extensive, focal hypermethylation regions unique to high-grade disease. These hypermethylation regions occurred not only in the promoters of genes but also in gene bodies and at intergenic regions that are enriched for DNA-protein binding sites.~Integration with existing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)~and survival data revealed regions where DNA methylation correlates with reduced gene expression associated with poor outcome. Regions specific to aggressive disease are proximal to genes with distinct functions from regions shared by indolent and aggressive disease. Our compendium of methylation changes reveals crucial molecular distinctions between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer.},

To examine this process, Bian et al. used a single-cell triple omics sequencing (scTrio-seq) technique to examine the mutations, transcriptome, and methylome within colorectal cancer tumors and metastases from 10 individual patients. The analysis provided insights into tumor evolution, linked DNA methylation to genetic lineages, and showed that DNA methylation levels are consistent within lineages but can differ substantially among clones. Science, this issue p. 1060 Although genomic instability, epigenetic abnormality, and gene expression dysregulation are hallmarks of colorectal cancer, these features have not been simultaneously analyzed at single-cell resolution. Using optimized single-cell multiomics sequencing together with multiregional sampling of the primary tumor and lymphatic and distant metastases, we developed insights beyond intratumoral heterogeneity. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 patients whose DNA we sequenced. The cancer cells' DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue and those of repetitive element long interspersed nuclear element 1. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing genetic lineages and tracing their epigenomic and transcriptomic dynamics with single-cell multiomics sequencing.

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a clonal accumulation of mature neoplastic B cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors, plays an important role in the control of mature B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation. In this study, we showed that Aiolos expression is up-regulated in B-CLL cells. This overexpression does not implicate isoform imbalance or disturb Aiolos subcellular localization. The chromatin status at the Aiolos promoter in CLL is defined by the demethylation of DNA and an enrichment of euchromatin associated histone markers, such as the dimethylation of the lysine 4 on histone H3. These epigenetic modifications should allow its upstream effectors, such as nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B, constitutively activated in CLL, to gain access to promoter, resulting up-regulation of Aiolos. To determine the consequences of Aiolos deregulation in CLL, we analyzed the effects of Aiolos overexpression or down-regulation on apoptosis. Aiolos is involved in cell survival by regulating the expression of some Bcl-2 family members. Our results strongly suggest that Aiolos deregulation by epigenetic modifications may be a hallmark of CLL.},

  abstract = {Imaging chromatin spatial organization The genome is organized within the nucleus as three-dimensional domains that modulate DNA-templated processes. Bintu et al. used high-throughput Oligopaint labeling and imaging to observe chromatin dynamics inside the nuclei of several different mammalian cell lines. After combining the datasets, single-cell matrices revealed chromatin arranged in topologically associating domains (TADs). Removing cohesin resulted in a loss of aggregate TADs among populations of cells, but specific TADs were still detected at the single-cell level. Furthermore, higher-order organization was detected, suggestive of cooperative interactions within the genome. Science, this issue p. eaau1783 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONChromatin adopts an intricate three-dimensional (3D) organization in the nucleus that is critical for many genome processes, from gene regulation to genome replication. Our understanding of the chromatin organization remains relatively poor at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, which spans the sizes of individual genes and regulatory domains and is thus of critical importance to genome regulation. Recent Hi-C experiments revealed topologically associating domains (TADs) as a ubiquitous chromatin organization feature in many organisms. However, the basic properties of TADs, including whether TADs represent a fundamental unit of genome organization in individual cells or an emergent property from cell population averaging, and the formation mechanism of TADs, remain unclear. In addition, our understanding of genome organization is largely built on pairwise interactions, whereas relatively little is known about higher-order chromatin interactions. Methods that provide a high-resolution visualization of chromatin structure in individual cells will elucidate these and many other questions related to genome organization. RATIONALEWe report a super-resolution chromatin tracing method that allows determination of both the structural features and their genomic coordinates with high resolution in single cells. We reason that if numerous chromatin loci could be identified and precisely localized in individual cells, connecting their positions would allow us to trace the chromatin conformation. However, typical multicolor imaging allows only a few loci to be simultaneously imaged. To overcome this challenge, we partitioned the targeted genomic region into numerous segments, each 30 kb in length, and imaged individual segments using sequential rounds of fluorescence in situ hybridization. This allowed us to generate a 3D super-resolution image of the chromatin in numerous pseudocolors, each reporting the position and structure of a 30-kb segment with nanometer-scale precision. RESULTSOur imaging data revealed an abundance of TAD-like domain structures with spatially segregated globular conformations in single cells. The domain boundaries varied from cell to cell, exhibiting nonzero probability of residing at any genome positions, but with a preference at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not alter the prevalence of TAD-like structures in single cells; only the preferential positioning of domain boundaries was lost, explaining the loss of population-level TADs. Our results suggest that cohesin is not required for the formation or maintenance of single-cell domain structures, but that their preferential boundary positions are influenced by cohesin-CTCF interaction.In addition, we observed prevalent multiway interactions among triplets of chromatin loci. These higher-order interactions were cooperative, i.e., most three-way contacts were observed at higher frequencies than would be expected from the frequency of pairwise interactions. Notably, these multiway interactions were also retained after cohesin depletion. CONCLUSIONOur imaging method offers a high-resolution physical view of chromatin conformation of targeted genomic regions in single cells, providing a powerful and complementary approach to sequencing-based genome-wide methods for interrogating genome organization. The TAD-like structures and multiway chromatin interactions observed in single cells add important constraints on genome folding and have implications for understanding the role of genome structure in diverse biological processes from enhancer-promoter communication to genome compartmentalization. We envision that future work will further improve the resolution and genomic coverage of this approach and will combine the imaging of chromatin with regulatory factors and/or expressed RNAs to reveal the underlying mechanism and functional implication of chromosome organization. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6413/eaau1783/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals TAD-like domain structures in single cells.Consecutive 30-kb segments of a chromatin region of interest were sequentially imaged with diffraction-limited or super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The pseudocolored images of the positions of individual chromatin segments in single cells and the corresponding matrices of intersegment distances reveal TAD-like structures with a globular conformation in single cells. The population-average matrix reveals TADs at the ensemble level. The spatial organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation.

These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

Around 80\% of GIST have varying molecular changes, predominantly mutually exclusive activating KIT or PDGFRA mutations, but other, rare subtypes also exist. Localized GIST are curable, and surgery is their standard treatment. Risk factors for relapse are tumour size, mitotic index, non-gastric site and tumour rupture. Patients with GIST with KIT or PDGFRA mutations sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib that are at high risk of relapse have improved survival with adjuvant imatinib treatment. In advanced disease, median overall survival has improved from 18 months to {$>$}70 months since the introduction of TKIs. The role of surgery in the advanced setting remains unclear. Resistance to TKIs arise mainly from subclonal selection of cells with resistance mutations in KIT or PDGFRA when they are the primary drivers. Advanced resistant GIST respond to second-line sunitinib and third-line regorafenib, as well as to the new broad-spectrum TKI ripretinib. Rare molecular forms of GIST with alterations involving NF1, SDH genes, BRAF or NTRK genes generally show primary resistance to standard TKIs, but some respond to specific inhibitors of the activated genes. Despite major advances, many questions in both advanced and localized disease remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {Mammalian development is associated with extensive changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and nuclear structure. Here, we follow such changes associated with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and X inactivation by integrating, for the first time, allele-specific data from these three modalities obtained by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C. Allele-specific contact decay profiles obtained by single-cell Hi-C clearly show that the inactive X chromosome has a unique profile in differentiated cells that have undergone X inactivation. Loss of this inactive X-specific structure at mitosis is followed by its reappearance during the cell cycle, suggesting a ``bookmark'' mechanism. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to follow the onset of X inactivation is associated with changes in contact decay profiles that occur in parallel on both the X chromosomes and autosomes. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq show evidence of a delay in female versus male cells, due to the presence of two active X chromosomes at early stages of differentiation. The onset of the inactive X-specific structure in single cells occurs later than gene silencing, consistent with the idea that chromatin compaction is a late event of X inactivation. Single-cell Hi-C highlights evidence of discrete changes in nuclear structure characterized by the acquisition of very long-range contacts throughout the nucleus. Novel computational approaches allow for the effective alignment of single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromosome structure. Based on trajectory analyses, three distinct nuclear structure states are detected reflecting discrete and profound simultaneous changes not only to the structure of the X chromosomes, but also to that of autosomes during differentiation. Our study reveals that long-range structural changes to chromosomes appear as discrete events, unlike progressive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility.},

  abstract = {Heritable phenotypic variation in plants can be caused not only by underlying genetic differences, but also by variation in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. However, we still know very little about how relevant such epigenetic variation is to the ecology and evolution of natural populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we treated a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and examined the consequences of this treatment for plant traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Experimental demethylation strongly reduced the growth and fitness of plants and delayed their flowering, but the degree of this response varied significantly among genotypes. Differences in genotypes' responses to demethylation were only weakly related to their genetic relatedness, which is consistent with the idea that natural epigenetic variation is independent of genetic variation. Demethylation also altered patterns of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the amount of phenotypic variation observed among plant individuals and genotype means. We have demonstrated that epigenetic variation can have a dramatic impact on ecologically important plant traits and their variability, as well as on the fitness of plants and their ecological interactions. Epigenetic variation may thus be an overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of plant populations.},

The ability to define such rules for epialleles \textendash{} analogous to the rules at the DNA sequence level \textendash{} would thus have profound implications for our understanding of epigenetic variation and evolution. Here, we focus on promoter methylation in the male human germline, which \textendash{} apart from its role in gene regulation \textendash{} is also known to greatly increase the mutation rate of CpG dinucleotides. We first develop a simple but general approach for detecting selection on epialleles, which does not require populationscale data. We then show that germline promoter methylation is deleterious at loss-of-function intolerant genes, but neutral at loss-of-function tolerant ones. In concordance with this, a human-mouse comparative analysis of sperm methylomes reveals strong suppression of methylation acquisition at loss-of-function intolerant promoters. We demonstrate that this selection is neither a secondary consequence of germline gene expression levels, nor of promoter H3K4me3 levels. Rather, the deleteriousness of promoter methylation is explained by its mutagenic effect on the underlying CpGs. Our results thus address a long-standing open question in molecular evolution, providing the first demonstration of selection acting on an epigenetic mutation rate modifier to locally dictate the mutation rate in humans. They also suggest the existence of a mechanism that preferentially protects loss-of-function intolerant promoters from methylation in the germline. Finally, they directly refute the prevailing dogma that CpG islands are not under active selection.},

We initially determined the copy number aberration (CNA) profiles of 74 patients with index tumors of Gleason score 7. Of these, 5 patients were subjected to whole-genome sequencing using DNA quantities achievable in diagnostic biopsies, with detailed spatial sampling of 23 distinct tumor regions to assess intraprostatic heterogeneity in focal genomics. Multifocal tumors are highly heterogeneous for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), CNAs and genomic rearrangements. We identified and validated a new recurrent amplification of MYCL, which is associated with TP53 deletion and unique profiles of DNA damage and transcriptional dysregulation. Moreover, we demonstrate divergent tumor evolution in multifocal cancer and, in some cases, tumors of independent clonal origin. These data represent the first systematic relation of intraprostatic genomic heterogeneity to predicted clinical outcome and inform the development of novel biomarkers that reflect individual prognosis.},

Waddington's epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes\textemdash change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.},

  abstract = {A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the ``clines versus clusters'' problem in modeling population genetic variation, and remedies some of the overfitting to which nonspatial models are prone. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.},

Here we used engineered nucleases to induce simultaneous specific double strand breaks in the MLL gene and two different known translocation partners (AF4 and AF9), which resulted in specific chromosomal translocations in K562 cells as well as primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The initiation of a specific MLL translocation in a small number of HSPCs likely mimics the leukemia-initiating event that occurs in patients. In our studies, the creation of specific MLL translocations in CD34+ cells was not sufficient to transform cells in vitro. Rather, a variety of fates was observed for translocation positive cells including cell loss over time, a transient proliferative advantage followed by loss of the clone, or a persistent proliferative advantage. These studies highlight the application of genome engineering tools in primary human HSPCs to induce and prospectively study the consequences of initiating translocation events in leukemia pathogenesis.},

Each anatomic subtype has distinct genetic aberrations, clinical presentations and therapeutic approaches. In endemic regions, liver fluke infection is associated with CCA, owing to the oncogenic effect of the associated chronic biliary tract inflammation. In other regions, CCA can be associated with chronic biliary tract inflammation owing to choledocholithiasis, cholelithiasis, or primary sclerosing cholangitis, but most CCAs have no identifiable cause. Administration of the anthelmintic drug praziquantel decreases the risk of CCA from liver flukes, but reinfection is common and future vaccination strategies may be more effective. Some patients with CCA are eligible for potentially curative surgical options, such as resection or liver transplantation. Genetic studies have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of CCA, and two aberrations that drive the pathogenesis of non-fluke-associated intrahepatic CCA, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 fusions and isocitrate dehydrogenase gain-of-function mutations, can be therapeutically targeted. CCA is a highly desmoplastic cancer and targeting the tumour immune microenvironment might be a promising therapeutic approach. CCA remains a highly lethal disease and further scientific and clinical insights are needed to improve patient outcomes.},

The approach consists of the capture of methylated DNA using the MBD domain of MeCP2, and subsequent next-generation sequencing of eluted DNA. Elution of the captured methylated DNA is done in steps using a salt gradient, which stratifies the genome into fractions with different CpG density. The enrichment reached within the individual eluates allows for cost-effective deep sequence coverage. The profiles together yield a detailed genome-wide map of methylated regions and readily allows detection of DNA methylation in known and novel regions.

Inhibitors directed against DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases\textemdash DNMTi and HDACi, respectively\textemdash are used for the treatment of several hematopoietic malignancies 1,2 . Although these compounds have been in clinical use for several years, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding their mode of action 3 . Two previous stud-ies on DNMTi in cancer cell lines reported the upregulation of dou-ble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, originating from codogenic endogenous retroviruses (ERV), followed by an interferon response and the induction of viral defense genes 4,5 . However, it remains unclear how other classes of epigenetic drugs integrate into these findings and whether there are additional effects potentially missed by candidate gene approaches. Here, we globally mapped DNMTi-and HDACi-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic changes by using whole-genome profiling technologies (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1) and show that the vast majority of TSSs that transcriptionally responded toward epigenetic modulation were cryptic, currently non-annotated TSSs encoded in solitary long-ter-minal repeats (LTRs). RESULTS Epigenetic drugs activate cryptic TSSs in the DAPK1 gene To efficiently measure the effects of epigenetic drugs on endogenous gene expression, we engineered the lung cancer cell line NCI-H1299 by introducing a dual fluorescence/resistance reporter (EGFP-NEO) into intron 3 of DAPK1, which is epigenetically silenced in associa-tion with CpG-island hypermethylation (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). Upon treatment with the DNMTi 5-aza-2{${'}$}-deoxycytidine (DAC) or with siRNAs or shRNAs targeting DNMT1 mRNA, the DNMT and HDAC inhibitors induce cryptic transcription start sites encoded in long terminal repeats},

By assaying multiple topographically distinct tumor sites, premalignant lesions, and lymph node metastases within five cases of prostate cancer, we demonstrate that both DNA methylation and copy-number heterogeneity consistently reflect the life history of the tumors. Furthermore, we show cases of genetic or epigenetic convergent evolution and highlight the diversity in the evolutionary origins and aberration spectrum between tumor and metastatic subclones. Importantly, DNA methylation can complement genetic data by serving as a proxy for activity at regulatory domains, as we show through identification of high epigenetic heterogeneity at androgen-receptor-bound enhancers. Epigenome variation thereby expands on the current genome-centric view on tumor heterogeneity.},

However using a human CpG island microarray it was revealed that 174 CG-containing sequences were differentially methylated between G1 and S. Seventy-five percent of all the variations in DNA methylation detected in unique sequences represented hypomethylation at G0, with changes occurring in both CpG islands and non-CpG islands. This is the first demonstration of a dynamic DNA methylation pattern within a single cell cycle of a mature somatic cell.

We introduce GINOM (Genomic INterval Overlap Model), a new method that enables testing of significant associations between multiple genomic features. We demonstrate GINOM's ability to identify higher-order associations with both simulated and real data. In particular, we used GINOM to explore L1 retrotransposable element insertion bias in lung cancer and found a significant pairwise association between L1 insertions and heterochromatic marks. Unlike other methods, GINOM also detected an association between L1 insertions and gene bodies marked by a facultative heterochromatic mark, which could explain the observed bias for L1 insertions towards cancer-associated genes.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash n},

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Background:There is a need to develop robust and clinically applicable gene expression signatures. Hypoxia is a key factor promoting solid tumour progression and resistance to therapy; a hypoxia signature has the potential to be not only prognostic but also to predict benefit from particular interventions.Methods:An approach for deriving signatures that combine knowledge of gene function and analysis of in vivo co-expression patterns was used to define a common hypoxia signature from three head and neck and five breast cancer studies. Previously validated hypoxia-regulated genes (seeds) were used to generate hypoxia co-expression cancer networks.Results:A common hypoxia signature, or metagene, was derived by selecting genes that were consistently co-expressed with the hypoxia seeds in multiple cancers. This was highly enriched for hypoxia-regulated pathways, and prognostic in multivariate analyses. Genes with the highest connectivity were also the most prognostic, and a reduced metagene consisting of a small number of top-ranked genes, including VEGFA, SLC2A1 and PGAM1, outperformed both a larger signature and reported signatures in independent data sets of head and neck, breast and lung cancers.Conclusion:Combined knowledge of multiple genes' function from in vitro experiments together with meta-analysis of multiple cancers can deliver compact and robust signatures suitable for clinical application.},

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

  abstract = {B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. Although the genetic determinants underlying disease onset remain unclear, epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are suggested to contribute significantly to leukemogenesis. Using the Illumina 450K array, we assessed DNA methylation in matched tumor-normal samples of 46 childhood patients with pre-B ALL, extending single CpG-site resolution analysis of the pre-B ALL methylome beyond CpG-islands (CGI). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of CpG-site neighborhood, gene, or microRNA (miRNA) gene-associated methylation levels separated the tumor cohort according to major pre-B ALL subtypes, and methylation in CGIs, CGI shores, and in regions around the transcription start site was found to significantly correlate with transcript expression. Focusing on samples carrying the t(12;21) ETV6\textendash RUNX1 fusion, we identified 119 subtype-specific high-confidence marker CpG-loci. Pathway analyses linked the CpG-loci\textendash associated genes with hematopoiesis and cancer. Further integration with whole-transcriptome data showed the effects of methylation on expression of 17 potential drivers of leukemogenesis. Independent validation of array methylation and sequencing-derived transcript expression with Sequenom Epityper technology and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, respectively, indicates more than 80\% empirical accuracy of our genome-wide findings. In summary, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling enabled us to separate pre-B ALL according to major subtypes, to map epigenetic biomarkers specific for the t(12;21) subtype, and through a combined methylome and transcriptome approach to identify downstream effects on candidate drivers of leukemogenesis.

From the characterization of more than 6,000 proteins, 27,000 transcripts, and 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified coordinated changes associated with early differentiation steps. DMRs show continuous gain or loss of methylation during differentiation, and the overall change in DNA methylation correlates inversely with gene expression at key loci. Our data reveal the differential expression landscape of 493 transcription factors and 682 lncRNAs and highlight specific expression clusters operating in HSCs. We also found an unexpectedly dynamic pattern of transcript isoform regulation, suggesting a critical regulatory role during HSC differentiation, and a cell cycle/DNA repair signature associated with multipotency in MPP2 cells. This study provides a comprehensive genome-wide resource for the functional exploration of molecular, cellular, and epigenetic regulation at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy.},

Additionally, we introduce a simple technique for visualizing causal models on probability spaces that is useful both for generating examples and developing causal intuition. Finally, we provide an axiomatic framework for causality and make initial steps towards a formal theory of general causal models.},

Here, we analyze MYOD-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts to myotubes, a well-characterized model system for direct conversion by defined factors, at pseudotemporal resolution~using single-cell RNA-seq. To expose barriers to efficient conversion, we introduce a novel analytic technique, trajectory alignment, which enables quantitative comparison of gene expression kinetics across two biological processes. Reprogrammed cells navigate a trajectory with branch points that correspond to two alternative decision points, with cells that select incorrect branches terminating at aberrant or incomplete reprogramming outcomes. Analysis of these branch points revealed insulin and BMP signaling as crucial molecular determinants of reprogramming. Single-cell trajectory alignment enables rigorous quantitative comparisons between biological trajectories found in diverse processes in development, reprogramming, and other contexts.},

It is an enduring goal to catalog our human cell types, to understand how they develop, how they vary between individuals, and how they fail in disease. Single-cell genomics has revolutionized this endeavor because sequencing-based methods provide a means to quantitatively annotate cell states on the basis of high-information content and high-throughput measurements. Together with advances in stem cell biology and gene editing, we are in the midst of a fascinating journey to understand the cellular phenotypes that compose human bodies and how the human genome is used to build and maintain each cell. Here, we will review recent advances into how single-cell genomics is being used to develop personalized phenotyping strategies that cross subcellular, cellular, and tissue scales to link our genome to our cumulative cellular phenotypes.},

Double strand breaks may trigger nonhomologous end joining repair, leading to frameshift mutations, or homology-directed repair using an extrachromosomal template. Alternatively, genomic deletions may be produced by a pair of double strand breaks. The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletions has not been systematically explored. Here, we present a methodology for the production of deletions in mammalian cells, ranging from 1.3 kb to greater than 1 Mb. We observed a high frequency of intended genomic deletions. Nondeleted alleles are nonetheless often edited with inversions or small insertion/deletions produced at CRISPR recognition sites. Deleted alleles also typically include small insertion/deletions at predicted deletion junctions. We retrieved cells with biallelic deletion at a frequency exceeding that of probabilistic expectation. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between deletion frequency and deletion size. This work suggests that CRISPR/Cas9 is a robust system to produce a spectrum of genomic deletions to allow investigation of genes and genetic elements.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor prognosis, and new strategies for prevention and treatment are urgently needed. We previously reported that histone H4 acetylation is elevated in pancreatic acinar cells harboring Kras mutations prior to the appearance of premalignant lesions. Because acetyl-CoA abundance regulates global histone acetylation, we hypothesized that altered acetyl-CoA metabolism might contribute to metabolic or epigenetic alterations that promote tumorigenesis. We found that acetyl-CoA abundance is elevated in KRAS-mutant acinar cells and that its use in the mevalonate pathway supports acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Pancreas-specific loss of the acetyl-CoA\textendash producing enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) accordingly suppresses ADM and tumor formation. In PDA cells, growth factors promote AKT\textendash ACLY signaling and histone acetylation, and both cell proliferation and tumor growth can be suppressed by concurrent BET inhibition and statin treatment. Thus, KRAS-driven metabolic alterations promote acinar cell plasticity and tumor development, and targeting acetyl-CoA\textendash dependent processes exerts anticancer effects. Significance: Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest of human malignancies. We identify a key role for the metabolic enzyme ACLY, which produces acetyl-CoA, in pancreatic carcinogenesis. The data suggest that acetyl-CoA use for histone acetylation and in the mevalonate pathway facilitates cell plasticity and proliferation, suggesting potential to target these pathways.See related commentary by Halbrook et al., p. 326.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 305},

Advances in single-cell epigenomic profiling methods are enabling high-resolution mapping of chromatin states in individual cells.

  abstract = {Posterior fossa ependymoma comprise three distinct molecular variants, termed PF-EPN-A (PFA), PF-EPN-B (PFB), and PF-EPN-SE (subependymoma). Clinically, they are very disparate and PFB tumors are currently being considered for a trial of radiation avoidance. However, to move forward, unraveling the heterogeneity within PFB would be highly desirable. To discern the molecular heterogeneity within PFB, we performed an integrated analysis consisting of DNA methylation profiling, copy-number profiling, gene expression profiling, and clinical correlation across a cohort of 212 primary posterior fossa PFB tumors. Unsupervised spectral clustering and t-SNE analysis of genome-wide methylation data revealed five distinct subtypes of PFB tumors, termed PFB1-5, with distinct demographics, copy-number alterations, and gene expression profiles. All PFB subtypes were distinct from PFA and posterior fossa subependymomas. Of the five subtypes, PFB4 and PFB5 are more discrete, consisting of younger and older patients, respectively, with a strong female-gender enrichment in PFB5 (age: p = 0.011, gender: p = 0.04). Broad copy-number aberrations were common; however, many events such as chromosome 2 loss, 5 gain, and 17 loss were enriched in specific subtypes and 1q gain was enriched in PFB1. Late relapses were common across all five subtypes, but deaths were uncommon and present in only two subtypes (PFB1 and PFB3). Unlike the case in PFA ependymoma, 1q gain was not a robust marker of poor progression-free survival; however, chromosome 13q loss may represent a novel marker for risk stratification across the spectrum of PFB subtypes. Similar to PFA ependymoma, there exists a significant intertumoral heterogeneity within PFB, with distinct molecular subtypes identified. Even when accounting for this heterogeneity, extent of resection remains the strongest predictor of poor outcome. However, this biological heterogeneity must be accounted for in future preclinical modeling and personalized therapies.},

  abstract = {Background: Human methylome mapping in health and disease states has largely relied on Illumina Human Methylation 450k array (450k array) technology. Accompanying this has been the necessary evolution of analysis pipelines to facilitate data processing. The majority of these pipelines, however, cater for experimental designs where matched 'controls' or 'normal' samples are available. Experimental designs where no appropriate 'reference' exists remain challenging. Herein, we use data generated from our study of the inheritance of methylome profiles in families to evaluate the performance of eight normalisation pre-processing methods. Fifty individual samples representing four families were interrogated on five 450k array BeadChips. Eight normalisation methods were tested using qualitative and quantitative metrics, to assess efficacy and suitability. Results: Stratified quantile normalisation combined with ComBat were consistently found to be the most appropriate when assessed using density, MDS and cluster plots. This was supported quantitatively by ANOVA on the first principal component where the effect of batch dropped from p {$<$} 0.01 to p = 0.97 after stratified QN and ComBat. Median absolute differences between replicated samples were the lowest after stratified QN and ComBat as were the standard error measures on known imprinted regions. Biological information was preserved after normalisation as indicated by the maintenance of a significant association between a known mQTL and methylation (p = 1.05e-05). Conclusions: A strategy combining stratified QN with ComBat is appropriate for use in the analyses when no reference sample is available but preservation of biological variation is paramount. There is great potential for use of 450k array data to further our understanding of the methylome in a variety of similar settings. Such advances will be reliant on the determination of appropriate methodologies for processing these data such as established here.},

  abstract = {Kaposi sarcoma (KS) gained public attention as an AIDS-defining malignancy; its~appearance on the skin was a highly stigmatizing sign of HIV infection during the height of the AIDS epidemic. The widespread introduction of effective antiretrovirals to control HIV by restoring immunocompetence reduced the prevalence of AIDS-related KS, although KS does occur in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection. KS also presents in individuals without HIV infection in older men (classic KS), in sub-Saharan Africa (endemic KS) and in transplant recipients (iatrogenic KS). The aetiologic agent of KS is KS herpesvirus (KSHV; also known as human herpesvirus-8), and viral proteins can induce KS-associated cellular changes that enable the virus to evade the host immune system and allow the infected cell to survive and proliferate despite viral infection. Currently, most cases of KS occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where KSHV infection is prevalent owing to transmission by saliva in childhood compounded by the ongoing AIDS epidemic. Treatment for early AIDS-related KS in previously untreated patients should start with the control of HIV with antiretrovirals, which frequently results in KS regression. In advanced-stage KS, chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel is the most common treatment, although it is seldom curative. In sub-Saharan Africa, KS continues to have a poor prognosis. Newer treatments for KS based on the mechanisms of its pathogenesis are being explored.},

The macrosatellite repeat DXZ4, localized at Xq23-24, consists of 50-100 copies of a CpG-rich 3-kb monomer. Here I report that on the active X chromosome (Xa), DXZ4 is organized into constitutive heterochromatin characterized by a highly organized pattern of H3K9me3. DXZ4 is expressed from both strands and generates an antisense transcript that is processed into small RNAs that directly correlate with H3K9me3 nucleosomes. In contrast, on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) a proportion of DXZ4 is packaged into euchromatin characterized by H3K4me2 and H3K9Ac. The Xi copy of DXZ4 is bound by the chromatin insulator, CTCF, within a sequence that unidirectionally blocks enhancer-promoter communication. Immediately adjacent to the CTCF-binding site is a bidirectional promoter that, like the sequence flanking the CTCF-binding region, is completely devoid of CpG methylation on the Xi. As on the Xa, both strands are expressed, but longer antisense transcripts can be detected in addition to the processed small RNAs. The euchromatic organization of DXZ4 on the otherwise heterochromatic Xi, its binding of CTCF, and its function as a unidirectional insulator suggest that this macrosatellite has acquired a novel function unique to the process of X chromosome inactivation.},

Many of these variants constitute strong candidates underlying phenotypic variation, including tandem duplications and a transposable element insertion that dramatically amplifies the expression of detoxification genes associated with nicotine resistance. The abundance of important genetic variation that still evades discovery highlights how crucial high quality references are to deciphering phenotypes.},

Genes in such networks are subject to expression noise, resulting in isogenic cell populations exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in protein levels. Increasing evidence suggests that cells have evolved regulatory strategies to limit, tolerate or amplify expression noise. In this context, fundamental questions arise: how can the architecture of gene regulatory networks generate, make use of or be constrained by expression noise? Here, we discuss the interplay between expression noise and gene regulatory network at different levels of organization, ranging from a single regulatory interaction to entire regulatory networks. We then consider how this interplay impacts a variety of phenomena, such as pathogenicity, disease, adaptation to changing environments, differential cell-fate outcome and incomplete or partial penetrance effects. Finally, we highlight recent technological developments that permit measurements at the single-cell level, and discuss directions for future research.},

We therefore studied methylation in ACF from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or sporadic colorectal cancer. We assessed methylation status of the p16 tumor suppressor gene, MINT1 (methylated in tumor 1), MINT2, MINT31, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene, and hMLH1 mismatch repair gene. We compared methylation to ACF histopathology, K-ras proto-oncogene mutation, loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p, and microsatellite instability. Methylation was present in 34\% (21 of 61) of ACF, including both FAP and sporadic types, but was more frequent in sporadic ACF [53\% (18 of 34) versus 11\% (3 of 27), P = 0.002], especially dysplastic sporadic ACF [75\% (3 of 4) versus 8\% (2 of 24), P = 0.004]. MINT31 was more frequently methylated in heteroplastic ACF than dysplastic ACF [35\% (11 of 31) versus 7\% (2 of 30), P = 0.01]. Strong associations of ACF methylation with K-ras mutation (P = 0.007) and with loss of chromosome 1p (P = 0.04) were observed, but methylation was the only molecular abnormality identified in 16\% (10 of 61) of ACF. Our findings suggest that methylation in ACF is an early event in the pathogenesis of a subset of colorectal carcinomas, and that ACF from FAP patients and patients with sporadic colorectal cancer have distinct epigenetic changes that reflect differences in molecular pathogenesis.},

In line with early postulations of an epigenetic role in gene regulation, symmetric CpG methylation can be mitotically propagated over many generations with extraordinarily high fidelity. Here, we combine BrdU labeling and immunoprecipitation with genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to explore the inheritance of cytosine methylation onto newly replicated DNA in human cells. Globally, we observe a pronounced lag between the copying of genetic and epigenetic information in embryonic stem cells that is reconsolidated within hours to accomplish faithful mitotic transmission. Populations of arrested cells show a global reduction of lag-induced intermediate CpG methylation when compared to proliferating cells, whereas sites of transcription factor engagement appear cell-cycle invariant. Alternatively, the cancer cell line HCT116 preserves global epigenetic heterogeneity independently of cell-cycle arrest. Taken together, our data suggest that heterogeneous methylation largely reflects asynchronous proliferation, but is intrinsic to actively engaged cis-regulatory elements and cancer.},

These studies have mainly defined genetic changes as either causal, providing a selective advantage to the cancer cell (a driver mutation) or consequential with no selective advantage (not directly causal, a passenger mutation). A vast unresolved question is how a primary cancer cell becomes metastatic and what are the molecular events that underpin this process. However, extensive sequencing efforts indicate that mutation may not be a causal factor for primary to metastatic transition. On the other hand, epigenetic changes are dynamic in nature and therefore potentially play an important role in determining metastatic phenotypes and this area of research is just starting to be appreciated. Unlike genetic studies, current limitations in studying epigenetic events in cancer metastasis include a lack of conceptual understanding and an analytical framework for identifying putative driver and passenger epigenetic changes. In this review, we discuss the key concepts involved in understanding the role of epigenetic alterations in the metastatic cascade. We particularly focus on driver epigenetic events, and we describe analytical approaches and biological frameworks for distinguishing between ``epi-driver'' and ``epi-passenger'' events in metastasis. Finally, we suggest potential directions for future research in this important area of cancer research.},

We develop a model for integrating these data, which reveals two classes of TFs with distinct ranges of regulatory influence, chromatin-binding preferences, and auto-regulatory properties.

Several platforms have been developed to study genome-wide DNA methylation. Many investigators in the field have chosen the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation microarray for its ability to reliably assess DNA methylation following sodium bisulfite conversion. Here, we analyzed methylation profiles of 489 adult males and 357 adult females generated by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray. Among the autosomal CpG sites that displayed significant methylation differences between the two sexes, we observed a significant enrichment of cross-reactive probes co-hybridizing to the sex chromosomes with more than 94\% sequence identity. This could lead investigators to mistakenly infer the existence of significant autosomal sex-associated methylation. Using sequence identity cutoffs derived from the sex methylation analysis, we concluded that 6\% of the array probes can potentially generate spurious signals because of co-hybridization to alternate genomic sequences highly homologous to the intended targets. Additionally, we discovered probes targeting polymorphic CpGs that overlapped SNPs. The methylation levels detected by these probes are simply the reflection of underlying genetic polymorphisms but could be misinterpreted as true signals. The existence of probes that are cross-reactive or of target polymorphic CpGs in the Illumina HumanMethylation microarrays can confound data obtained from such microarrays. Therefore, investigators should exercise caution when significant biological associations are found using these array platforms. A list of all cross-reactive probes and polymorphic CpGs identified by us are annotated in this paper.},

  abstract = {Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons are mutagens that are capable of generating deleterious mutations by inserting themselves into genes and affecting gene function in the human genome. In normal cells, the activity of LINE-1 retrotransposon is mostly repressed, maintaining a stable genome structure. In contrast, cancer cells are characterized by aberrant expression of LINE-1 retrotransposons, which, in principle, have the potential to contribute to genomic instability. The mechanistic pathways that regulate LINE-1 expression remain unclear. Using deep-sequencing small RNA analysis, we identified a subset of differentially expressed endo-siRNAs that directly regulate LINE-1 expression. Detailed analyses suggest that these endo-siRNAs are significantly depleted in human breast cancer cells compared with normal breast cells. The overexpression of these endo-siRNAs in cancer cells markedly silences endogenous LINE-1 expression through increased DNA methylation of the LINE-1 5{${'}$}-UTR promoter. The finding that endo-siRNAs can silence LINE-1 activity through DNA methylation suggests that a functional link exists between the expression of endo-siRNAs and LINE-1 retrotransposons in human cells.},

Here we describe the reason why spike-in controls are so important and explain how to appropriately design and use spike-in controls for normalization.

  abstract = {Summary The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using~TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting~a~hypothesis centered on ``chromatin-state'' to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a~computational method to infer causal enhancer-gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer {$\sim$}140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers.},

Studies have linked allele-specific genetic changes to gene expression, DNA methylation, and histone marks but these investigations have only been carried out in a limited set of samples. RESULTS We describe a large-scale coordinated study of allelic and non-allelic effects on DNA methylation, histone mark deposition, and gene expression, detecting the interrelations between epigenetic and functional features at unprecedented resolution. We use information from whole genome and targeted bisulfite sequencing from 910 samples to perform genotype-dependent analyses of allele-specific methylation (ASM) and non-allelic methylation (mQTL). In addition, we introduce a novel genotype-independent test to detect methylation imbalance between chromosomes. Of the \textasciitilde 2.2 million CpGs tested for ASM, mQTL, and genotype-independent effects, we identify \textasciitilde 32\% as being genetically regulated (ASM or mQTL) and \textasciitilde 14\% as being putatively epigenetically regulated. We also show that epigenetically driven effects are strongly enriched in repressed regions and near transcription start sites, whereas the genetically regulated CpGs are enriched in enhancers. Known imprinted regions are enriched among epigenetically regulated loci, but we also observe several novel genomic regions (e.g., HOX genes) as being epigenetically regulated. Finally, we use our ASM datasets for functional interpretation of disease-associated loci and show the advantage of utilizing na\"ive T cells for understanding autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSIONS Our rich catalogue of haploid methylomes across multiple tissues will allow validation of epigenome association studies and exploration of new biological models for allelic exclusion in the human genome.},

However, the degree and variability of chromatin modifications in specific human immune cells remain largely unknown. Here, we employ a highly multiplexed mass cytometry analysis to profile the global levels of a broad array of chromatin modifications in primary human immune cells at the single-cell level. Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-specific chromatin modification patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modifications. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modifications and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable influences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modifications.},

  abstract = {Chromatin Immunopreciptation (ChIP)-seq is used extensively to identify sites of transcription factor binding or regions of epigenetic modifications to the genome. A key step in ChIP-seq analysis is peak calling, where genomic regions enriched for ChIP versus control reads are identified. Many programs have been designed to solve this task, but nearly all fall into the statistical trap of using the data twice\textemdash once to determine candidate enriched regions, and again to assess enrichment by classical statistical hypothesis testing. This double use of the data invalidates the statistical significance assigned to enriched regions, thus the true significance or reliability of peak calls remains unknown.Using simulated and real ChIP-seq data, we show that three well-known peak callers, MACS, SICER and diffReps, output biased P-values and false discovery rate estimates that can be many orders of magnitude too optimistic. We propose a wrapper algorithm, RECAP, that uses resampling of ChIP-seq and control data to estimate a monotone transform correcting for biases built into peak calling algorithms. When applied to null hypothesis data, where there is no enrichment between ChIP-seq and control, P-values recalibrated by RECAP are approximately uniformly distributed. On data where there is genuine enrichment, RECAP P-values give a better estimate of the true statistical significance of candidate peaks and better false discovery rate estimates, which correlate better with empirical reproducibility. RECAP is a powerful new tool for assessing the true statistical significance of ChIP-seq peak calls.The RECAP software is available through www.perkinslab.ca or on github at https://github.com/theodorejperkins/RECAP.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we use a spatial stochastic cellular automaton model of tumour growth that accounts for somatic mutations, selection, drift and spatial constraints, to simulate multi-region sequencing data derived from spatial sampling of a neoplasm. We show that the spatial structure of a solid cancer has a major impact on the detection of clonal selection and genetic drift from both bulk and single-cell sequencing data. Our results indicate that spatial constrains can introduce significant sampling biases when performing multi-region bulk sampling and that such bias becomes a major confounding factor for the measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of human tumours. We also propose a statistical inference framework that incorporates spatial effects within a growing tumour and so represents a further step forwards in the inference evolutionary dynamics from genomic data. Our analysis shows that measuring cancer evolution using next-generation sequencing while accounting for the numerous confounding factors remains challenging. However, mechanistic model-based approaches have the potential to capture the sources of noise and better interpret the data.},

BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes that are thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.},

DNA methylation is commonly analyzed using bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq)-based designs, such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq). Furthermore, there has been growing interest in investigating the roles that genetic variants play in changing the methylation levels (i.e. methylation quantitative trait loci or meQTLs), how methylation regulates the imprinting of gene expression (i.e. allele-specific methylation or ASM) and the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among different cell types. However, none of the current simulation tools can generate different BS-seq data types (e.g. WGBS, RRBS and oxBS-seq) while modeling meQTLs, ASM and DMRs.We developed profile-based whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data simulator (pWGBSSimla), a profile-based bisulfite sequencing data simulator, which simulates WGBS, RRBS and oxBS-seq data for different cell types based on real data. meQTLs and ASM are modeled based on the block structures of the methylation status at CpGs, whereas the simulation of DMRs is based on observations of methylation rates in real data. We demonstrated that pWGBSSimla adequately simulates data and allows performance comparisons among different methylation analysis methods.pWGBSSimla is available at https://omicssimla.sourceforge.io.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Furthermore, we have identified endogenous mCpmCpG methylation of an Sp1 site in the CpG island promoter of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene by genomic sequencing. This occurs in a proportion of retinoblastoma tumors which are extensively CpG methylated in the Rb promoter. The results raise the possibility that mCpmCpG methylation could have a biological function in preventing Sp1 binding, thereby contributing to the subsequent abnormal methylation of CpG islands often observed in tumor cells.},

It is fundamental for cellular differentiation and control of transcriptional potential. DNA methylation is involved also in several processes that are central to evolutionary biology, including phenotypic plasticity and evolvability. In this study, we explored the relationship between CpG islands methylation and signatures of selective pressure in Homo Sapiens, using a computational biology approach. By analyzing methylation data of 25 cell lines from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium, we compared the DNA methylation of CpG islands in genomic regions under selective pressure with the methylation of CpG islands in the remaining part of the genome. To define genomic regions under selective pressure, we used three different methods, each oriented to provide distinct information about selective events. Independently of the method and of the cell type used, we found evidences of undermethylation of CGIs in human genomic regions under selective pressure. Additionally, by analyzing SNP frequency in CpG islands, we demonstrated that CpG islands in regions under selective pressure show lower genetic variation. Our findings suggest that the CpG islands in regions under selective pressure seem to be somehow more ``protected'' from methylation when compared with other regions of the genome.},

Here we describe a blood test that can detect eight common cancer types through assessment of the levels of circulating proteins and mutations in cell-free DNA. We applied this test, called CancerSEEK, to 1,005 patients with non-metastatic, clinically detected cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK tests were positive in a median of 70\% of the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69\% to 98\% for the detection of five cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening tests available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of CancerSEEK was {$>$} 99\%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83\% of the patients.},

The incidence of HL is highest in adolescents and young adults, although HL can affect elderly individuals. Diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissue from a lymph node biopsy; the tissue morphology and antigen expression profile enable classification into one of the four types of classic HL (nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-depleted or lymphocyte-rich HL), which account for the majority of cases, or nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL. Although uncommon, HL remains a crucial test case for progress in cancer treatment. HL was among the first systemic neoplasms shown to be curable with radiation therapy and multiagent chemotherapy. The goal of multimodality therapy is to minimize lifelong residual treatment-associated toxicity while maintaining high levels of effectiveness. Recurrent or refractory disease can be effectively treated or cured with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and prospective trials have demonstrated the potency of immunotherapeutic approaches with antibody\textendash drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This Primer explores the wealth of information that has been assembled to understand HL; these updated observations verify that HL investigation and treatment remain at the leading edge of oncological research.},

  abstract = {Cancer chromatin accessibility landscape The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a high-quality resource of molecular data on a large variety of human cancers. Corces et al. used a recently modified assay to profile chromatin accessibility to determine the accessible chromatin landscape in 410 TCGA samples from 23 cancer types (see the Perspective by Taipale). When the data were integrated with other omics data available for the same tumor samples, inherited risk loci for cancer predisposition were revealed, transcription factors and enhancers driving molecular subtypes of cancer with patient survival differences were identified, and noncoding mutations associated with clinical prognosis were discovered. Science, this issue p. eaav1898; see also p. 401 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Although the 2\% of the human genome that encodes proteins has been extensively studied, much remains to be learned about the noncoding genome and gene regulation in cancer. Genes are turned on and off in the proper cell types and cell states by transcription factor (TF) proteins acting on DNA regulatory elements that are scattered over the vast noncoding genome and exert long-range influences. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a global consortium that aims to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. TCGA has systematically collected DNA mutation, methylation, RNA expression, and other comprehensive datasets from primary human cancer tissue. TCGA has served as an invaluable resource for the identification of genomic aberrations, altered transcriptional networks, and cancer subtypes. Nonetheless, the gene regulatory landscapes of these tumors have largely been inferred through indirect means. RATIONALEA hallmark of active DNA regulatory elements is chromatin accessibility. Eukaryotic genomes are compacted in chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins, and only the active regulatory elements are accessible by the cell's machinery such as TFs. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) quantifies DNA accessibility through the use of transposase enzymes that insert sequencing adapters at these accessible chromatin sites. ATAC-seq enables the genome-wide profiling of TF binding events that orchestrate gene expression programs and give a cell its identity. RESULTSWe generated high-quality ATAC-seq data in 410 tumor samples from TCGA, identifying diverse regulatory landscapes across 23 cancer types. These chromatin accessibility profiles identify cancer- and tissue-specific DNA regulatory elements that enable classification of tumor subtypes with newly recognized prognostic importance. We identify distinct TF activities in cancer based on differences in the inferred patterns of TF-DNA interaction and gene expression. Genome-wide correlation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility predicts tens of thousands of putative interactions between distal regulatory elements and gene promoters, including key oncogenes and targets in cancer immunotherapy, such as MYC, SRC, BCL2, and PDL1. Moreover, these regulatory interactions inform known genetic risk loci linked to cancer predisposition, nominating biochemical mechanisms and target genes for many cancer-linked genetic variants. Lastly, integration with mutation profiling by whole-genome sequencing identifies cancer-relevant noncoding mutations that are associated with altered gene expression. A single-base mutation located 12 kilobases upstream of the FGD4 gene, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, generates a putative de novo binding site for an NKX TF and is associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and a concomitant increase in FGD4 gene expression. CONCLUSIONThe accessible genome of primary human cancers provides a wealth of information on the susceptibility, mechanisms, prognosis, and potential therapeutic strategies of diverse cancer types. Prediction of interactions between DNA regulatory elements and gene promoters sets the stage for future integrative gene regulatory network analyses. The discovery of hundreds of noncoding somatic mutations that exhibit allele-specific regulatory effects suggests a pervasive mechanism for cancer cells to manipulate gene expression and increase cellular fitness. These data may serve as a foundational resource for the cancer research community. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6413/eaav1898/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Cancer gene regulatory landscape.Chromatin accessibility profiling of 23 human cancer types (left) in 410 tumor samples from TCGA revealed 562,709 DNA regulatory elements. The activity of these DNA elements organized cancer subtypes, identified TF proteins and regulatory elements controlling cancer gene expression, and suggested molecular mechanisms for cancer-associated inherited variants and somatic mutations in the noncoding genome. See main article for abbreviations of cancer types. Ref., reference; Var., variant. We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples spanning 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709 transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. These data reveal genetic risk loci of cancer predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in cancer, identify gene-regulatory interactions underlying cancer immune evasion, and pinpoint noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in cancer to advance diagnosis and therapy. Chromatin accessibility profiling identifies principles of epigenetic regulation in 23 primary human cancers.

Because p73 encodes for a protein that is both structurally and functionally homologous to the p53 protein, p73 has been postulated to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene. To date, however, mutations of p73 have not been found. To study methylation of the p73 5{${'}$}CpG island, a human bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing exon 1 and the 5{${'}$} region of p73 was isolated. There was no evidence for p73 exon 1 methylation in normal tissues. In contrast, p73 was aberrantly methylated in approximately 30\% of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and Burkitt's lymphomas. There was no evidence for methylation in any other types of hematological malignancies or solid tumors examined. In both leukemia cell lines and primary ALLs, methylation was associated with transcriptional loss of p73 by reverse transcription-PCR. We used single-strand conformational polymorphisms to screen for point mutations in a series of primary ALLs and found no mutations leading to a change in protein structure. Our results show that methylation of p73 is a frequent event in specific types of hematological malignancies and suggest that epigenetic silencing of p73 could have important consequences for cell-cycle regulation.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the impact of heritable epigenetic variation on complex traits is an emerging challenge in population genetics. Here, we analyze a population of isogenic Arabidopsis lines that segregate experimentally induced DNA methylation changes at hundreds of regions across the genome. We demonstrate that several of these differentially methylated regions (DMRs) act as bona fide epigenetic quantitative trait loci (QTLepi), accounting for 60 to 90\% of the heritability for two complex traits, flowering time and primary root length. These QTLepi are reproducible and can be subjected to artificial selection. Many of the experimentally induced DMRs are also variable in natural populations of this species and may thus provide an epigenetic basis for Darwinian evolution independently of DNA sequence changes. Plant Epigenetics Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are genetic regions associated with phenotypic traits that help to determine the underlying genetics controlling the magnitude of a specific trait. Cortijo et al. (p. 1145, published online 6 February; see the Perspective by Schmitz) identified epigenetic QTLs associated with differences in methylation marks (epiQTLs) controlling flowering time and root length in the model plant Arabidopsis. These epiQTLs were mapped in genetically identical lines that differ only in their methylation marks. A small number of QTLs were able to explain up to 90\% of the heritable variation in these traits. Thus, in plants, the heritability of some complex traits can be determined by epigenetic variation. Genetic mapping reveals epigenetic changes associated with flowering time and root length.

  abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally inefficient. To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.

Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of over 15,000 single cells. Science, this issue p. 910 Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas. Combinatorial indexing can identify chromatin states at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial indexing can identify chromatin states at single-cell resolution.},

The advent of microarrays has led to a new paradigm in deciphering breast cancer heterogeneity, based on which the intrinsic subtyping system using prognostic multigene classifiers was developed. Subtypes identified using different gene panels, though overlap to a great extent, do not completely converge, and the avail of new information and perspectives has led to the emergence of novel subtypes, which complicate our understanding towards breast tumor heterogeneity. This review explores and summarizes the existing intrinsic subtypes, patient clinical features and management, commercial signature panels, as well as various information used for tumor classification. Two trends are pointed out in the end on breast cancer subtyping, i.e., either diverging to more refined groups or converging to the major subtypes.

According to this second scenario, tumors act as caricatures of their corresponding normal tissues and are sustained in their growth by a pathological counterpart of normal adult stem cells, cancer stem cells. This model, first developed in human myeloid leukemias, is today being extended to solid tumors, such as breast and brain cancer.

  abstract = {Background Screening for prostate cancer (PCa) has dramatically declined in the United States (US) since the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based PCa screening in all men in 2012. This led to dramatic reductions in the diagnosis of localized disease across all clinical risk groups. Objective In light of decreased PSA screening for men in the US, we sought to study trends in newly diagnosed metastatic PCa incidence and how this may vary by race and age. Design, setting, and participants We analyzed new PCa incidence by stage at diagnosis between 1988 and 2015 within the Cancer Registry of Greater California. We further stratified the patients by age and four major race/ethnicity groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white [NHW], non-Hispanic black [NHB], and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander [API]). Incidence rates were calculated and compared per 100000 and age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Outcome measurement and statistical analysis The primary outcome was incidence of metastatic PCa at the time of cancer diagnosis. Joinpoint regression program was used to detect changes in incidence and to calculate the average percent change (APC) over time. All data were analyzed using SEER*Stat version 8.1.15 and Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.1.0, and a two-sided p value of {$<$}0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results and limitations Adjusted rates of metastatic PCa incidence for NHW men significantly increased by 4.3\% since 2010, while remaining down (NHB, Hispanic) or level (API) for other racial groups. Stratified by age, incidence of metastatic disease for all races has increased significantly for men aged 64\textendash 75 yr since 2008 with an APC of 2.8\% while remaining level for other age groups. The limitations of our study include retrospective design and no data on extent of PSA screening in the study cohort. Conclusions Incidence rates of newly diagnosed metastatic PCa have significantly increased for NHW men and men aged 65\textendash 74 yr. Patient summary Prostate-specific antigen screening has declined in the Unites States with a subsequent sharp drop in the incidence of screen-detected localized prostate cancer. The incidence of men presenting with metastatic disease seems to be rising recently, and men should continue to discuss the benefits of PSA screening with their primary care doctor.},

  abstract = {Alterations of genes encoding transcriptional regulators of lymphoid development are a hallmark of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and most commonly involve PAX5, encoding the DNA-binding transcription factor paired-box 5. The majority of PAX5 alterations in ALL are heterozygous, and key PAX5 target genes are expressed in leukemic cells, suggesting that PAX5 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. To examine the role of PAX5 alterations in leukemogenesis, we performed mutagenesis screens of mice heterozygous for a loss-of-function Pax5 allele. Both chemical and retroviral mutagenesis resulted in a significantly increased penetrance and reduced latency of leukemia, with a shift to B-lymphoid lineage. Genomic profiling identified a high frequency of secondary genomic mutations, deletions, and retroviral insertions targeting B-lymphoid development, including Pax5, and additional genes and pathways mutated in ALL, including tumor suppressors, Ras, and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. These results show that in contrast to simple Pax5 haploinsufficiency, multiple sequential alterations targeting lymphoid development are central to leukemogenesis and contribute to the arrest in lymphoid maturation characteristic of ALL. This cross-species analysis also validates the importance of concomitant alterations of multiple cellular growth, signaling, and tumor suppression pathways in the pathogenesis of B-ALL.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia is pervasive in cancer and other diseases. Cells sense and adapt to hypoxia by activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), but it is still an outstanding question why cell types differ in their transcriptional response to hypoxia. We report that HIFs fail to bind CpG dinucleotides that are methylated in their consensus binding sequence, both in in vitro biochemical binding assays and in vivo studies of differentially methylated isogenic cell lines. Based on in silico structural modeling, we show that 5-methylcytosine indeed causes steric hindrance in the HIF binding pocket. A model wherein cell-type-specific methylation landscapes, as laid down by the differential expression and binding of other transcription factors under normoxia, control cell-type-specific hypoxia responses is observed. We also discover ectopic HIF binding sites in repeat regions which are normally methylated. Genetic and pharmacological DNA demethylation, but also cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation, expose these binding sites, inducing HIF-dependent expression of cryptic transcripts. In line with such cryptic transcripts being more prone to cause double-stranded RNA and viral mimicry, we observe low DNA methylation and high cryptic transcript expression in tumors with high immune checkpoint expression, but not in tumors with low immune checkpoint expression, where they would compromise tumor immunotolerance. In a low-immunogenic tumor model, DNA demethylation upregulates cryptic transcript expression in a HIF-dependent manner, causing immune activation and reducing tumor growth. Our data elucidate the mechanism underlying cell-type-specific responses to hypoxia and suggest DNA methylation and hypoxia to underlie tumor immunotolerance.},

Here we demonstrate that the bromodomain of CBP binds to histone H3 acetylated on lysine 56 (K56Ac) with higher affinity than to its other monoacetylated binding partners. We show that autoacetylation of CBP is critical for the bromodomain-H3 K56Ac interaction, and we propose that this interaction occurs via autoacetylation-induced conformation changes in CBP. Unexpectedly, the bromodomain promotes acetylation of H3 K56 on free histones. The CBP bromodomain also interacts with the histone chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) via a nearby but distinct interface. This interaction is necessary for ASF1 to promote acetylation of H3 K56 by CBP, indicating that the ASF1-bromodomain interaction physically delivers the histones to the histone acetyl transferase domain of CBP. A CBP bromodomain mutation manifested in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome has compromised binding to both H3 K56Ac and ASF1, suggesting that these interactions are important for the normal function of CBP.},

This review outlines the basic evidence for use of hormonal therapy while highlighting major research developments made in the past year.         Recent findings~         Recent research on androgen deprivation therapy has suggested that patients with high-risk features may have longer metastasis-free survival with early initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Fracture risk has been shown to be significantly increased in patients on androgen deprivation therapy and is correlated with duration of treatment. In the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer, oral premarin has been shown to induce of prostate specific antigen responses more than 50\% in 32\% of patients, though thromboembolism remains a risk despite prophylactic low-dose warfarin. Transdermal estradiol has been associated with virtually no cardiovascular toxicity, but induced of prostate specific antigen responses more than 50\% in only 12.5\% of patients. Clinical studies of nilutamide, flutamide, and ketoconazole have further clarified efficacy of these secondary hormonal treatments.         Summary~         Optimal timing of androgen deprivation therapy awaits the results of randomized trials, but available evidence indicates that patients with high-risk features may benefit from early androgen deprivation therapy. New estrogen-based therapies have shown promising efficacy in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer, with significantly less cardiovascular toxicity than traditional estrogens.},

  abstract = {Tumor heterogeneity provides a complex challenge to cancer treatment and is a critical component of therapeutic response, disease recurrence, and patient survival. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have revealed the prevalence of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity. Computational techniques are essential to quantify the differences in variation of these profiles between distinct cell types, tumor subtypes, and patients to fully characterize intratumor and intertumor molecular heterogeneity. In this study, we adapted our algorithm for pathway dysregulation, Expression Variation Analysis (EVA), to perform multivariate statistical analyses of differential variation of expression in gene sets for scRNA-seq. EVA has high sensitivity and specificity to detect pathways with true differential heterogeneity in simulated data. EVA was applied to several public domain scRNA-seq tumor datasets to quantify the landscape of tumor heterogeneity in several key applications in cancer genomics such as immunogenicity, metastasis, and cancer subtypes. Immune pathway heterogeneity of hematopoietic cell populations in breast tumors corresponded to the amount of diversity present in the T-cell repertoire of each individual. Cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tumors had significantly more heterogeneity across pathways than cells from metastases, consistent with a model of clonal outgrowth. Moreover, there were dramatic differences in pathway dysregulation across HNSCC basal primary tumors. Within the basal primary tumors, there was increased immune dysregulation in individuals with a high proportion of fibroblasts present in the tumor microenvironment. These results demonstrate the broad utility of EVA to quantify intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity from scRNA-seq data without reliance on low-dimensional visualization. Significance: This study presents a robust statistical algorithm for evaluating gene expression heterogeneity within pathways or gene sets in single-cell RNA-seq data},

The most common constitutional abnormalities in BWS are epigenetic, involving abnormal methylation of either H19 or LIT1, which encode untranslated RNAs on 11p15. We hypothesized that different epigenetic alterations would be associated with specific phenotypes in BWS. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case-cohort study, using the BWS Registry. The cohort consisted of 92 patients with BWS and molecular analysis of both H19 and LIT1, and these patients showed the same frequency of clinical phenotypes as those patients in the Registry from whom biological samples were not available. The frequency of altered DNA methylation of H19 in patients with cancer was significantly higher, 56\% (9/16), than the frequency in patients without cancer, 17\% (13/76; P=.002), and cancer was not associated with LIT1 alterations. Furthermore, the frequency of altered DNA methylation of LIT1 in patients with midline abdominal-wall defects and macrosomia was significantly higher, 65\% (41/63) and 60\% (46/77), respectively, than in patients without such defects, 34\% (10/29) and 18\% (2/11), respectively (P=.012 and P=.02, respectively). Additionally, paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of 11p15 was associated with hemihypertrophy (P=.003), cancer (P=.03), and hypoglycemia (P=.05).

  abstract = {The cause of autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), which leads to loss of vision and blindness, was investigated in families lacking a molecular diagnosis. A refined locus for adRP on Chr17q22 (RP17) was delineated through genotyping and genome sequencing, leading to the identification of structural variants (SVs) that segregate with disease. Eight different complex SVs were characterized in 22 adRP-affected families with {$>$}300 affected individuals. All RP17 SVs had breakpoints within a genomic region spanning YPEL2 to LINC01476. To investigate the mechanism of disease, we reprogrammed fibroblasts from affected individuals and controls into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) or retinal organoids (ROs). Hi-C was performed on ROs, and differential expression of regional genes and a retinal enhancer RNA at this locus was assessed by qPCR. The epigenetic landscape of the region, and Hi-C RO data, showed that YPEL2 sits within its own topologically associating domain (TAD), rich in enhancers with binding sites for retinal transcription factors. The Hi-C map of RP17 ROs revealed creation of a neo-TAD with ectopic contacts between GDPD1 and retinal enhancers, and modeling of all RP17 SVs was consistent with neo-TADs leading to ectopic retinal-specific enhancer-GDPD1 accessibility. qPCR confirmed increased expression of GDPD1 and increased expression of the retinal enhancer that enters the neo-TAD. Altered TAD structure resulting in increased retinal expression of GDPD1 is the likely convergent mechanism of disease, consistent with a dominant gain of function. Our study highlights the importance of SVs as a genomic mechanism in unsolved Mendelian diseases.},

  abstract = {The mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has emerged as an important tool for linking genetic variation to changes in gene regulation1,2,3,4,5. However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available6,7,8. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10\%). We call such variants `DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16\%) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55\% of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.},

  abstract = {Noncoding variation and gene expression Natural genetic variation outside of protein coding regions affects multiple molecular phenotypes that can differ across individuals. To examine how genomic variation affects proximal (cis) or distal (trans) gene regulation, Delaneau et al. analyzed gene expression, chromatin, and the three-dimensional conformation of the genome. Clustering regulatory elements and activity across individuals reveals genomic structures termed cis-regulatory domains and trans-regulatory hubs that affect gene expression. Associations between these structures and genes within and across chromosomes contribute to links between noncoding genetic variation and gene expression. Science, this issue p. eaat8266 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONGenome-wide studies on the genetic basis of gene expression have advanced considerably our understanding of the function of the human genome. Large collections of expression quantitative trait loci (i.e., genetic variations affecting gene expression; eQTLs) are now available across many cell types, tissues, and conditions and are commonly used to better interpret the effects of noncoding genetic variations. Although this constitutes an extraordinary resource to study complex organismal traits and diseases, we still have a poor understanding of how they affect the regulatory machinery, which regulatory elements (REs) they perturb, and how their effects propagate along regulatory interactions. RATIONALEIn this study, we aimed to characterize the complex and cell type\textendash specific interplay between genetic variation, REs, and gene expression to dissect cis- and trans-regulatory coordination. To this end, we assembled and analyzed a population-scale dataset combining the activity of REs [measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for methylated histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), trimethylated histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and acetylated histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac)], the expression of genes (using RNA-seq), and genetic variations for 317 lymphoblastoid and 78 fibroblast cell lines, all from European ancestry. RESULTSFirst, we show that the regulatory activity is structured in 12,583 well-delimited cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) that respect the local chromatin organization into topologically associating domains (TADs) but constitute finer organization. Our work suggests that three-dimensional (3D) organization in cis can be broadly categorized into functionally linked and unlinked domains, with the most-linked ones corresponding to CRDs. In addition, we found 25,315 significant associations between CRDs located on distinct chromosomes that form 30 trans-regulatory hubs (TRHs). These TRHs are consistent with a higher-order chromatin organization into A and B nuclear compartments and show a signal of allelic coordination, suggesting that some of the trans associations are not transcriptionally mediated and result from a complex and higher-order 3D nucleus organization.Second, we show that CRDs and TRHs essentially delimit sets of active REs involved in the expression of most genes and provide a dense genome-wide map linking REs and genes. We show that these links vary substantially across cell types and are key factors involved in the cis and trans coexpression of genes.Third, we show that CRDs are under strong genetic control. We discovered a total of 58,968 chromatin peaks affected by nearby genetic variants (cQTLs), 6157 QTLs that affect the activity of CRDs (aCRD-QTLs), and 110 QTLs that affect the correlation structure within CRDs (sCRD-QTLs). These QTLs tend to locate close to their genomic targets, are enriched within functional regions of the genome, and frequently overlap genetic variants associated with complex traits.Finally, we show that CRDs and TRHs capture complex regulatory networks along which the effects of eQTLs are propagated and synergized to affect gene expression. Overall, we estimate that 75\% of the eQTLs also affect the activity of CRDs and describe four specific types of genetic effects that can be mediated by CRDs: (i) cis-eQTLs affecting distal genes, (ii) multiple cis-eQTLs with independent effects, (iii) multiple rare variants that have a cumulative effect, and (iv) trans-eQTLs. CONCLUSIONWe provide a genome-wide map of the coordination between REs and describe how this serves as a backbone for the propagation of noncoding genetic effects in cis and trans onto gene expression. We show how these types of data can reveal higher-order functional attributes of the genome and can serve as an effective prior to boost future association studies at both the discovery and interpretation levels. Overall, our study reveals the complexity and specificity of the cis- and trans-regulatory circuitry and its perturbation by genetic variations. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6439/eaat8266/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Interindividual correlation between nearby chromatin peaks forms CRDs in the context of TADs.CRDs capture the structure of the coordination between nearby REs along which genetic effects combine and propagate to distal genes.

Studying the genetic basis of gene expression and chromatin organization is key to characterizing the effect of genetic variability on the function and structure of the human genome. Here we unravel how genetic variation perturbs gene regulation using a dataset combining activity of regulatory elements, gene expression, and genetic variants across 317 individuals and two cell types. We show that variability in regulatory activity is structured at the intra- and interchromosomal levels within 12,583 cis-regulatory domains and 30 trans-regulatory hubs that highly reflect the local (that is, topologically associating domains) and global (that is, open and closed chromatin compartments) nuclear chromatin organization. These structures delimit cell type\textendash specific regulatory networks that control gene expression and coexpression and mediate the genetic effects of cis- and trans-acting regulatory variants on genes.

  abstract = {Hi-C is a sample preparation method that enables high-throughput sequencing to capture genome-wide spatial interactions between DNA molecules. The technique has been successfully applied to solve challenging problems such as 3D structural analysis of chromatin, scaffolding of large genome assemblies and more recently the accurate resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Despite continued refinements, however, preparing a Hi-C library remains a complex laboratory protocol. To avoid costly failures and maximise the odds of successful outcomes, diligent quality management is recommended. Current wet-lab methods provide only a crude assay of Hi-C library quality, while key post-sequencing quality indicators used have\textemdash thus far\textemdash relied upon reference-based read-mapping. When a reference is accessible, this reliance introduces a concern for quality, where an incomplete or inexact reference skews the resulting quality indicators. We propose a new, reference-free approach that infers the total fraction of read-pairs that are a product of proximity ligation. This quantification of Hi-C library quality requires only a modest amount of sequencing data and is independent of other application-specific criteria. The algorithm builds upon the observation that proximity ligation events are likely to create k-mers that would not naturally occur in the sample. Our software tool (qc3C) is to our knowledge the first to implement a reference-free Hi-C QC tool, and also provides reference-based QC, enabling Hi-C to be more easily applied to non-model organisms and environmental samples. We characterise the accuracy of the new algorithm on simulated and real datasets and compare it to reference-based methods.},

In recent years, our understanding of 5mC has changed due to advances in 5mC detection techniques that allow mapping of this mark on the whole genome scale. Profiling DNA methylomes from organisms across the eukaryotic tree of life has reshaped our views on the evolution of 5mC. In this review we explore the macro-evolution of 5mC in major eukaryotic groups, and then focus on recent advances made in animals. Genomic 5mC patterns as well as the mechanisms of 5mC deposition tend to be evolutionary labile across large phylogenetic distances, however, some common patterns are starting to emerge. Within the animal kingdom, 5mC diversity has proven to be much greater than anticipated. For example, a previously held common view that genome hypermethylation is a trait exclusive to vertebrates has recently been challenged. Also, data from genome-wide studies are starting to yield insights into the potential roles of 5mC in invertebrate cis regulation. Here we provide an evolutionary perspective of both the well-known and enigmatic roles of 5mC across the eukaryotic tree of life.},

It is the most stable epigenetic mark and is widely studied for its role in major biological processes. Aberrant DNA methylation is observed in various pathologies, such as cancer. Therefore, there is a great interest in analyzing subtle changes in DNA methylation induced by biological processes or upon drug treatments. Here, we developed an improved methodology based on flow cytometry to measure variations of DNA methylation level in melanoma and leukemia cells. The accuracy of DNA methylation quantification was validated with LC-ESI mass spectrometry analysis. The new protocol was used to detect small variations of cytosine methylation occurring in individual cells during their cell cycle and those induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC). Kinetic experiments confirmed that inheritance of DNA methylation occurs efficiently in S phase and revealed a short delay between DNA replication and completion of cytosine methylation. In addition, this study suggests that the uncoupling of 5AzadC effects on DNA demethylation and cell proliferation might be related to the duration of the DNA replication phase.},

TADs bring distant cis-regulatory elements into proximity, a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA binding factor CTCF. Surprisingly, genome-wide depletion of CTCF has little effect on transcription, yet structural variations affecting TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and congenital disease. Here, we investigate TAD function             in vivo             in mice by systematically editing components of TAD organization at the             Sox9             /             Kcnj             locus. We find that TADs are formed by a redundant system of CTCF sites requiring the removal of all major sites within the TAD and at the boundary for two neighboring TADs to fuse. TAD fusion resulted in leakage of regulatory activity from the             Sox9             to the             Kcnj             TAD, but no major changes in gene expression. This indicates that TAD structures provide robustness and precision, but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Gene misexpression and resulting disease phenotypes, however, were attained by re-directing regulatory activity through inversions and/or the re-positioning of boundaries. Thus, efficient re-wiring of enhancer promoter interaction and aberrant disease causing gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires the re-direction of contacts.},

  abstract = {The Minimum Evolution (ME) approach to phylogeny estimation has been shown to be statistically consistent when it is used in conjunction with ordinary least-squares (OLS) tting of a metric to a tree structure. The traditional approach to using ME has been to start with the Neighbor Joining (NJ) topology for a given matrix and then do a topological search from that starting point. The rst stage requires O(n 3) time, where n is the number of taxa, while the current implementations of the second are in O(p n 3) or more, where p is the number of swaps performed by the program. In this paper, we examine a greedy approach to minimum evolution which produces a starting topology in O(n 2) time. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that searches for the best topology using nearest neighbor interchanges (NNIs), where the cost of doing p NNIs is O(n 2 C p n), i.e., O(n 2) in practice because p is always much smaller than n. The Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) algorithm, when used in combination with NNIs, produces trees which are fairly close to NJ trees in terms of topological accuracy. We also examine ME under a balanced weighting scheme, where sibling subtrees have equal weight, as opposed to the standard " unweighted " OLS, where all taxa have the same weight so that the weight of a subtree is equal to the number of its taxa. The balanced minimum evolution scheme (BME) runs slower than the OLS version, requiring O(n 2 \textsterling{} diam(T)) operations to build the starting tree and O(p n \textsterling{} diam(T)) to perform the NNIs, where diam(T) is the topological diameter of the output tree. In the usual Yule-Harding distribution on phylogenetic trees, the diameter expectation is in log(n), so our algorithms are in practice faster that NJ. Moreover, this BME scheme yields a very signii cant improvement over NJ and other distance-based algorithms, especially with large trees, in terms of topological accuracy.},

The technology relies on the original and, in hindsight, remarkably simple idea that digestion and religation of fixed chromatin in cells, followed by the quantification of ligation junctions, allows for the determination of DNA contact frequencies and insight into chromosome topology. Here we evaluate and compare the current 3C-based methods (including 4C [chromosome conformation capture-on-chip], 5C [chromosome conformation capture carbon copy], HiC, and ChIA-PET), summarize their contribution to our current understanding of genome structure, and discuss how shape influences genome function.},

  abstract = {Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor progression. Here we analyze the performance of four CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict the true distribution of paths of tumor progression and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. Employing simulations we show that if fitness landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness maximum) there is good agreement between true and predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor with the currently common much smaller sample sizes. Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor and improves only slightly with sample size. In all cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is a key determinant of performance. Estimates of evolutionary unpredictability from the best performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to overestimate the true unpredictability and the bias is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for several of the data sets. But most of the predictions of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable, and unreliability increases with the number of features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting cancer progression but that, currently, obtaining useful predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological work that can account for the probably multi-peaked fitness landscapes in cancer.},

In particular, sequencing DNA from the immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes (ChIP-seq) and methylated DNA (MeDIP-seq) can reveal the locations of protein binding sites and epigenetic modifications. These approaches contain numerous biases which may significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting data. Rigorous computational methods for detecting and removing such biases are still lacking. Also, multi-sample normalization still remains an important open problem. This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques. Statistical methods for separating ChIP-seq signal from background noise, as well as correcting enrichment test statistics for sequence-dependent and sonication biases, are presented. Our method effectively separates reads into signal and background components prior to normalization, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, most peak callers currently use a generic null model which suffers from low specificity at the sensitivity level requisite for detecting subtle, but true, ChIP enrichment. The proposed method of determining a cell type-specific null model, which accounts for cell type-specific biases, is shown to be capable of achieving a lower false discovery rate at a given significance threshold than current methods.},

Despite extensive information on the ALL transcriptome and methylome, there is limited understanding of the ALL chromatin landscape. We therefore mapped accessible chromatin in 24 primary ALL cell biospecimens comprising three common molecular subtypes (DUX4/ERG, ETV6-RUNX1 and hyperdiploid) from patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Our findings highlight extensive chromatin reprogramming in ALL, including the identification ALL subtype-specific chromatin landscapes that are additionally modulated by genetic variation. Chromatin accessibility differences between ALL and normal B-cells implicate the activation of B-cell repressed chromatin domains and detail the disruption of normal B-cell development in ALL. Among ALL subtypes, we uncovered roles for basic helix-loop-helix, homeodomain and activator protein 1 transcription factors in promoting subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and distinct gene regulatory networks. In addition to chromatin subtype-specificity, we further identified over 3500 DNA sequence variants that alter the ALL chromatin landscape and contribute to inter-individual variability in chromatin accessibility. Collectively, our data suggest that subtype-specific chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks impact ALL biology and contribute to transcriptomic differences among ALL subtypes.},

  abstract = {Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer and characterized by considerable morphological and mutational heterogeneity. However, little is known about the epigenomic intratumor variability between spatially separated histological growth patterns of ADC. In order to reconstruct the clonal evolution of histomorphological patterns, we performed global DNA methylation profiling of 27 primary tumor regions, seven matched normal tissues, and six lymph node metastases from seven ADC cases. Additionally, we investigated the methylation data from 369 samples of the TCGA ADC cohort. All regions showed varying degrees of methylation changes between segments of different, but also of the same growth patterns. Similarly, copy number variations were seen between spatially distinct segments of each patient. Hierarchical clustering of promoter methylation revealed extensive heterogeneity within and between the cases. Intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity demonstrated a branched clonal evolution of ADC regions driven by genomic instability with subclonal copy number changes. Notably, methylation profiles within tumors were not more similar to each other than to those from other individuals. In two cases, different tumor regions of the same individuals were represented in distant clusters of the TCGA cohort, illustrating the extensive epigenomic intratumor heterogeneity of ADCs. We found no evidence for the lymph node metastases to be derived from a common growth pattern. Instead, they had evolved early and separately from a particular pattern in each primary tumor. Our results suggest that extensive variation of epigenomic features contributes to the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of primary ADCs and lymph node metastases.

It forms when both retinoblastoma gene (RB1) alleles are mutated in a susceptible retinal cell, probably a cone photoreceptor precursor. Loss of the tumour-suppressive functions of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) leads to uncontrolled cell division and recurrent genomic changes during tumour progression. Although pRB is expressed in almost all tissues, cone precursors have biochemical and molecular features that may sensitize them to RB1 loss and enable tumorigenesis. Patient survival is {$>$}95\% in high-income countries but {$<$}30\% globally. However, outcomes are improving owing to increased disease awareness for earlier diagnosis, application of new guidelines and sharing of expertise. Intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy have emerged as promising methods to salvage eyes that with conventional treatment might have been lost. Ongoing international collaborations will replace the multiple different classifications of eye involvement with standardized definitions to consistently assess the eligibility, efficacy and safety of treatment options. Life-long follow-up is warranted, as survivors of heritable retinoblastoma are at risk for developing second cancers. Defining the molecular consequences of RB1 loss in diverse tissues may open new avenues for treatment and prevention of retinoblastoma, as well as second cancers, in patients with germline RB1 mutations.},

To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.},

In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories1. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide2. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term `topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

  abstract = {Polymer-based simulations and experimental studies indicate the existence of a spatial dependency between the adjacent DNA fibers involved in the formation of chromatin loops. However, the existing strategies for detecting differential chromatin interactions assume that the interacting segments are spatially independent from the other segments nearby. To resolve this issue, we developed a new computational method, FIND, which considers the local spatial dependency between interacting loci. FIND uses a spatial Poisson process to detect differential chromatin interactions that show a significant difference in their interaction frequency and the interaction frequency of their neighbors. Simulation and biological data analysis show that FIND outperforms the widely used count-based methods and has a better signal-to-noise ratio.},

In this study, we have investigated how targeted disruption of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b affects the growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our studies led to the following observations. 1) Constitutive or conditional deletion of Dnmt3b, but not Dnmt3a, resulted in partial loss of DNA methylation throughout the genome, suggesting that Dnmt3b, in addition to the major maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, is required for maintaining DNA methylation in MEF cells. 2) Dnmt3b-deficient MEF cells showed aneuploidy and polyploidy, chromosomal breaks, and fusions. 3) Inactivation of Dnmt3b resulted in either premature senescence or spontaneous immortalization of MEF cells. 4) The G(1) to S-phase checkpoint was intact in primary and spontaneously immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs because the p53 protein was inducible by DNA damage. Interestingly, protein levels of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 were increased in immortalized Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs even in the absence of p53 induction. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation may induce genomic instability, which in turn leads to spontaneous immortalization or premature senescence of Dnmt3b-deficient MEFs via a p53-independent mechanism.},

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown1,2. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.},

Here we analyse a panel of 47 ovarian cancer cell lines and identify those that have the highest genetic similarity to ovarian tumours. Our comparison of copy-number changes, mutations and mRNA expression profiles reveals pronounced differences in molecular profiles between commonly used ovarian cancer cell lines and high-grade serous ovarian cancer tumour samples. We identify several rarely used cell lines that more closely resemble cognate tumour profiles than commonly used cell lines, and we propose these lines as the most suitable models of ovarian cancer. Our results indicate that the gap between cell lines and tumours can be bridged by genomically informed choices of cell line models for all tumour types.},

  abstract = {TET2 somatic mutations occur in {$\sim$}10\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) but are of unknown significance. Herein, we show that TET2 is required for the humoral immune response and is a DLBCL tumor suppressor. TET2 loss of function disrupts transit of B cells through germinal centers (GC), causing GC hyperplasia, impaired class switch recombination, blockade of plasma cell differentiation, and a preneoplastic phenotype. TET2 loss was linked to focal loss of enhancer hydroxymethylation and transcriptional repression of genes that mediate GC exit, such as PRDM1. Notably, these enhancers and genes are also repressed in CREBBP-mutant DLBCLs. Accordingly, TET2 mutation in patients yields a CREBBP-mutant gene-expression signature, CREBBP and TET2 mutations are generally mutually exclusive, and hydroxymethylation loss caused by TET2 deficiency impairs enhancer H3K27 acetylation. Hence, TET2 plays a critical role in the GC reaction, and its loss of function results in lymphomagenesis through failure to activate genes linked to GC exit signals. Significance: We show that TET2 is required for exit of the GC, B-cell differentiation, and is a tumor suppressor for mature B cells. Loss of TET2 phenocopies CREBBP somatic mutation. These results advocate for sequencing TET2 in patients with lymphoma and for the testing of epigenetic therapies to treat these tumors.See related commentary by Shingleton and Dave, p. 1515.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494},

The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project (CPTP) is a prospective cohort study created as a population-health research platform for assessing the effect of genetics, behaviour, family health history and environment (among other factors) on chronic diseases. METHODS: Volunteer participants were recruited from the general Canadian population for a confederation of 5 regional cohorts. Participants were enrolled in the study and core information obtained using 2 approaches: attendance at a study assessment centre for all study measures (questionnaire, venous blood sample and physical measurements) or completion of the core questionnaire (online or paper), with later collection of other study measures where possible. Physical measurements included height, weight, percentage body fat and blood pressure. Participants consented to passive follow-up through linkage with administrative health databases and active follow-up through recontact. All participant data across the 5 regional cohorts were harmonized. RESULTS: A total of 307 017 participants aged 30\textendash 74 from 8 provinces were recruited. More than half provided a venous blood sample and/or other biological sample, and 33\% completed physical measurements. A total of 709 harmonized variables were created; almost 25\% are available for all participants and 60\% for at least 220 000 participants. INTERPRETATION: Primary recruitment for the CPTP is complete, and data and biosamples are available to Canadian and international researchers through a data-access process. The CPTP will support research into how modifiable risk factors, genetics and the environment interact to affect the development of cancer and other chronic diseases, ultimately contributing evidence to reduce the global burden of chronic disease.},

The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are not yet entirely understood. The pathophysiology of CTCL is complex and a single initiating factor has not yet been identified. Diagnosis is based on clinicopathological correlation and requires an interdisciplinary team. Treatment decision is made based on short-term and long-term goals. Therapy options comprise skin-directed therapies, such as topical steroids or phototherapy, and systemic therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapy. So far, the only curative treatment approach is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Novel therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, monoclonal antibodies or small molecules, are being investigated in clinical trials. Patients with CTCL have reduced quality of life and a lack of effective treatment options. Further research is needed to better identify the underlying mechanisms of CTCL development and course as well as to better tailor treatment strategies to individual patients.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) frequently relapse after chemotherapy, yet the mechanism by which AML reemerges is not fully understood. Herein, we show that primary AML cells enter a senescence-like phenotype following chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. This is accompanied by induction of senescence/inflammatory and embryonic diapause transcriptional programs, with downregulation of MYC and leukemia stem cell genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggested depletion of leukemia stem cells in vitro and in vivo, and enrichment for subpopulations with distinct senescence-like cells. This senescence effect was transient and conferred superior colony-forming and engraftment potential. Entry into this senescence-like phenotype was dependent on ATR, and persistence of AML cells was severely impaired by ATR inhibitors. Altogether, we propose that AML relapse is facilitated by a senescence-like resilience phenotype that occurs regardless of their stem cell status. Upon recovery, these post-senescence AML cells give rise to relapsed AMLs with increased stem cell potential. Significance: Despite entering complete remission after chemotherapy, relapse occurs in many patients with AML. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the relapse mechanism in AML and the development of targeted treatments to improve outcome. Here, we identified a senescence-like resilience phenotype through which AML cells can survive and repopulate leukemia.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1307},

  abstract = {Disruption of epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but epigenetic therapy is complicated by the complexity of the epigenome. Herein, we developed a long-term primary AML ex vivo platform to determine whether targeting different epigenetic layers with 5-azacytidine and LSD1 inhibitors would yield improved efficacy. This combination was most effective in TET2mut AML, where it extinguished leukemia stem cells and particularly induced genes with both LSD1-bound enhancers and cytosine-methylated promoters. Functional studies indicated that derepression of genes such as GATA2 contributes to drug efficacy. Mechanistically, combination therapy increased enhancer\textendash promoter looping and chromatin-activating marks at the GATA2 locus. CRISPRi of the LSD1-bound enhancer in patient-derived TET2mut AML was associated with dampening of therapeutic GATA2 induction. TET2 knockdown in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells induced loss of enhancer 5-hydroxymethylation and facilitated LSD1-mediated enhancer inactivation. Our data provide a basis for rational targeting of cooperating aberrant promoter and enhancer epigenetic marks driven by mutant epigenetic modifiers. Significance: Somatic mutations of genes encoding epigenetic modifiers are a hallmark of AML and potentially disrupt many components of the epigenome. Our study targets two different epigenetic layers at promoters and enhancers that cooperate to aberrant gene silencing, downstream of the actions of a mutant epigenetic regulator.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813},

These P-t-C draw on existing guidance on the return of genetic research results, while also integrating the IHEC Bioethics Workgroup's ELSI research on and discussion of the issues associated with epigenetic data as well as the experience of a return of results pilot study by the Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK). Major challenges include how to determine the clinical validity and actionability of epigenetic results, and considerations related to environmental exposures and epigenetic marks, including circumstances warranting the sharing of results with family members and third parties. Interdisciplinary collaboration and good public communication regarding epigenetic risk will be important to advance the return of results framework for epigenetic science.},

One major and immediate challenge for the theorists is to now produce models capable of making quantitatively accurate predictions of in vitro behavior. A second challenge is to derive models that explain results obtained from experiments performed in vivo, the results of which appear to call into question the assumed dominance of excluded-volume effects in vivo. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise)and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise)contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

Four repeats in the DMD bind CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) on the maternal allele and have been proposed to attract methylation on the paternal allele. We introduced point mutations into the DMD to deplete the repeats of CpGs while retaining CTCF-binding and enhancer-blocking activity. Maternal inheritance of the mutations left H19 expression and Igf2 imprinting intact, consistent with the idea that the DMD acts as an insulator. Conversely, paternal inheritance of these mutations disrupted maintenance of DMD methylation, resulting in biallelic H19 expression. Furthermore, an insulator was established on the paternally inherited mutated allele in vivo, reducing Igf2 expression and resulting in a 40\% reduction in size of newborn offspring. Thus, the nine CpG mutations in the DMD showed that the two parental-specific roles of the H19 DMD, methylation maintenance and insulator assembly, are antagonistic.},

The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68\% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41\% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9\% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32\% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67\% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41\% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication \textendash{} it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.},

We reconstructed the phylogenies of 293 localized prostate tumors linked to clinical outcome data. Multiple subclones were detected in 59\% of patients, and specific subclonal architectures associate with adverse clinicopathological features. Early tumor development is characterized by point mutations and deletions followed by later subclonal amplifications and changes in trinucleotide mutational signatures. Specific genes are selectively mutated prior to or following subclonal diversification, including MTOR, NKX3-1, and RB1. Patients with low-risk monoclonal tumors rarely relapse after primary therapy (7\%), while those with high-risk polyclonal tumors frequently do (61\%).

Their analysis is useful in several biomedical applications, like monitoring dose or drug treatment responses of patients over time in pharmacogenomics studies. Many statistical and data analysis tools have been used to extract useful information. In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), with its natural nonnegativity constraints, has demonstrated its ability to extract from 2D microarrays relevant information on specific genes involved in the particular biological process. In this paper, we propose a new NMF model, namely Orthogonal Joint Sparse NMF, to extract relevant information from 3D microarrays containing the time evolution of a 2D microarray, by adding additional constraints to enforce important biological proprieties useful for further biological analysis. We develop multiplicative updates rules that decrease the objective function monotonically, and compare our approach to state-of-the-art NMF algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets.},

During cell division, DNMT1 maintains the DNA methylation pattern of the newly synthesized daughter strand, while G9a methylates H3K9. Here, DNMT1 is shown to directly bind G9a both in vivo and in vitro and to colocalize in the nucleus during DNA replication. The complex of DNMT1 and G9a colocalizes with dimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me2) at replication foci. Similarly, another H3K9 histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, colocalizes with DNMT1 on heterochromatic regions of the nucleoli exclusively before cell division. Both DNMT1 and G9a are loaded onto the chromatin simultaneously in a ternary complex with loading factor PCNA during chromatin replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of DNMT1 impairs DNA methylation, G9a loading, and H3K9 methylation on chromatin and rDNA repeats, confirming DNMT1 as the primary loading factor. Additionally, the complex of DNMT1 and G9a led to enhanced DNA and histone methylation of in vitro assembled chromatin substrates. Thus, direct cooperation between DNMT1 and G9a provides a mechanism of coordinated DNA and H3K9 methylation during cell division.},

Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC dissects cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nystr\"om method, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis reveals \textasciitilde 370,000 candidate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate cell-type specific transcriptional regulators.},

Here we present genome-wide reference maps of the associated DNA methylation dynamics. We used a meta-epigenomic approach that combines DNA methylation profiles across many small pools of cells and performed single-cell methylome sequencing to assess cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The resulting dataset identified characteristic differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. We also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA methylation data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and provide a framework for studying blood-linked diseases.},

However, because most human transcription factors are essentially uncharacterized, the role of transcription factors in human health is currently greatly underappreciated.Technological advances (such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray or by sequencing) now allow transcription factor binding to be studied on a genome-wide scale.Recent discoveries, such as the finding that most transcription factors bind to thousands of places in the genome, that binding sites are not just localized to proximal promoter regions and that some binding sites lack sequences similar to the consensus motif, have stimulated new ideas concerning long-range and combinatorial regulation.Current genomic studies have not yet determined whether most human transcription factors bind alone or whether they cluster at hot spots in the genome. Answers to these questions require the genomic profiling of many more factors.A crucial unanswered question is whether all binding events have a functional outcome (perhaps under some specific condition or in a specific cell type) or whether some transcription factor\textendash genome interactions are simply irrelevant.Issues that remain to be addressed include the design of comprehensive studies (for example, should all factors be studied in all cell types) and functional validation (for example, how can we determine the role of one specific binding site in its normal genomic context).},

If recombination is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in regions of low recombination where there is not much variation and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small ({$<$}1 kb) region. Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are likely to have been influenced by positive selection.},

In this work, we have combined facile nuclear sub-fractionation approaches with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to improve detection and quantification of nuclear proteins in human cells and tissues. Nuclei are isolated and subjected to a series of extraction conditions that enrich for nucleoplasm, euchromatin, heterochromatin and nuclearmembrane associated proteins. Using this approach, we can measure peptides from over 70\% of the expressed nuclear proteome. As we are physically separating chromatin compartments prior to analysis, proteins can be assigned into functional chromatin environments to illuminate systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics. The integrity of nuclear sub-compartments were validated with immunofluorescence, which confirms the presence of key markers during chromatin extraction. We then apply this method to study the nuclear proteome-wide response to pharmacological degradation of the BET bromodomain proteins. BET degradation leads to widespread changes in chromatin composition, and we discover global HDAC1/2-mediated remodeling of chromatin previously bound by BET bromodomains. In summary, we have developed a technology for reproducible, comprehensive characterization of the nuclear proteome to observe the systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics.},

These genes are epigenetically disrupted at the earliest stages of malignancies, even before mutations, and thus cause altered differentiation throughout tumour evolution. The past decade of discovery in cancer epigenetics has revealed a number of similarities between cancer genes and stem cell reprogramming genes, widespread mutations in epigenetic regulators, and the part played by chromatin structure in cellular plasticity in both development and cancer. In the light of these discoveries, we suggest here a framework for cancer epigenetics involving three types of genes: 'epigenetic mediators', corresponding to the tumour progenitor genes suggested earlier; 'epigenetic modifiers' of the mediators, which are frequently mutated in cancer; and 'epigenetic modulators' upstream of the modifiers, which are responsive to changes in the cellular environment and often linked to the nuclear architecture. We suggest that this classification is helpful in framing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cancer.},

However, to comprehensively study the gene expression with the regulation of long-range E\textendash P interactions is a major challenge in the regulatory networks. As these types of gene expression are regulated by diverse genomic signatures, we presented a computational method to study the relationships between gene expression levels and diverse genomic signatures. In this paper, based on the datasets of long-range E\textendash P interactions, we extracted feature parameters from multiple signatures (e.g., epigenetic marks, transcription factors) and used regression models to predict the gene expression levels. In our results, we found that the predicted expression values correlated well with the measured expression values in both the interacting and non-interacting sets, and the correlation values of the interacting set were higher than that of the corresponding non-interacting set in each cell line, which indicated that the distal enhancers would cooperate with diverse genomic signatures to facilitate the expression level of target genes. By comparing the important signature features for the gene expression levels between the interacting and non-interacting sets in the same cell line, we found that the important specific signatures affect the gene expression regulated by distal enhancers. Our research provided additional insights about the roles of diverse signatures in gene expression with the regulation of distal enhancers.},

By contrast, OS at 5 years after relapse was 7\% (95\% CI = 4\%-9\%). Factors predicting a good outcome after salvage therapy were young age (OS of 12\% in patients younger than 20 years vs OS of 3\% in patients older than 50 years; 2P {$<$} .001) and short duration of first remission (CR1) (OS of 11\% in those with a CR1 of more than 2 years versus OS of 5\% in those with a CR1 of less than 2 years; 2P {$<$} .001). Treatment received in CR1 did not influence outcome after relapse. In a very highly selected subgroup of patients who were able to receive HSCT after relapse, some were long-term survivors. We conclude from a large, unselected series with mature follow-up that most adults with recurring ALL, whatever their prior treatment, cannot be rescued using currently available therapies.

Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells. Finally, either expression of mutant IDH1/2 or Tet2 depletion impaired hematopoietic differentiation and increased stem/progenitor cell marker expression, suggesting a shared proleukemogenic effect. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The eukaryotic genome is hierarchically organized in the cell nucleus into DNA loops, chromatin domains, compartments, and, ultimately, chromosomes. Many of the most prominent organizational features of genomes are highly reproducible on the population level and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting functional relevance. Numerous organizational features, such as the location of a gene or promoter-enhancer loops, have been implicated in the regulation of genome processes including transcription, replication, and repair. At the same time, single-cell analysis has revealed extensive stochasticity of gene expression, with individual genes undergoing cycles of bursts in activity and periods of inactivity. Because gene activity is closely linked to features of genome organization, the extent of variability of genome organization at the single-cell level has arisen as a question of interest. We review new findings that document extensive cell- and allele-specific variability of genome organization and discuss potential mechanisms of structural variability and its implications for genome function. ADVANCES Recent advances in genome mapping using single-cell biochemical and imaging methods have enabled systematic probing of higher-order genome organization at the level of individual cells. Results from these approaches validate observations from traditional population-based methods but also reveal that genome organization is considerably more variable than anticipated. In particular, specific chromatin-chromatin interactions appear to be present in only a relatively small fraction of cells in a population, and the genome organization at individual alleles in the same nucleus differs considerably. Furthermore, the internal shapes of structural features such as chromatin domains are fluid, and the genomic positions of the boundaries between chromatin domains vary from allele to allele. The highly variable nature of genome architecture points to a high degree of intrinsic noise in genome organization, in line with the observed stochasticity in gene expression. OUTLOOK The observed single-cell heterogeneity in genome organization challenges the traditional view of gene regulation, which assumes that the epigenetic landscape controlling gene activity is largely stable. Rather, it now appears that both the structure and activity of genes are dynamic and stochastic. These probabilistic features of genome organization have implications for how long-lasting cellular states are generated and how individual cells transition between states during physiological or pathological processes, in that they suggest that fluidity between cell states may be an underlying property of a population of cells. The extent and relevance of genome organization and function can be addressed experimentally using the wide arsenal of tools now available, including deep sequencing and single-molecule imaging of chromatin. A key question is whether variability in structural features of chromatin causes the stochastic activity of individual genes, or vice versa. Furthermore, although it is likely that the dynamic motion of chromatin and the randomness introduced during cell division contribute to variability in genome architecture, their importance and their roles in generating genome heterogeneity have not been characterized. An intriguing\textemdash and potentially far-reaching\textemdash possibility is that the variability of genome organization is cell type\textendash specific and actively regulated, which would add a novel layer of control to gene expression and genome function. Rather than implying that genome organization is not functionally relevant, the observed variation in genome organization suggests new mechanisms by which chromatin topology may affect cell function.},

Here, we compare these methods in silico in a simplified, yet controlled, framework against known 3D structures of polymer models of murine and human loci, which can recapitulate Hi-C, GAM and SPRITE experiments and multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) single-molecule conformations. We find that in silico Hi-C, GAM and SPRITE bulk data are faithful to the reference 3D structures whereas single-cell data reflect strong variability among single molecules. The minimal number of cells required in replicate experiments to return statistically similar contacts is different across the technologies, being lowest in SPRITE and highest in GAM under the same conditions. Noise-to-signal levels follow an inverse power law with detection efficiency and grow with genomic distance differently among the three methods, being lowest in GAM for genomic separations {$>$}1\,Mb.},

The algorithm can exploit the added information present in correlated longitudinal or multiregion samples and takes into account correlations along genomes caused by events such as copy-number changes. We apply cloneHD to two case studies: a breast cancer sample and time-resolved samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where we demonstrate that monitoring the response of a patient to therapy regimens is feasible.

We utilized intensive repeated-measures data\textemdash data that have been collected many times, across many individuals\textemdash to compare the distributions of bivariate correlations calculated within subjects vs. those calculated between subjects. Because the vast majority of social and medical science research aggregates across subjects, we aimed to assess how closely such aggregations reflect their constituent individuals. We provide evidence that conclusions drawn from aggregated data may be worryingly imprecise. Specifically, the variance in individuals is up to four times larger than in groups. These data call for a focus on idiography and open science that may substantially alter best-practice guidelines in the medical and behavioral sciences. Only for ergodic processes will inferences based on group-level data generalize to individual experience or behavior. Because human social and psychological processes typically have an individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure design were used for symmetric comparisons of interindividual and intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87\textendash 94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic aberrations are widespread in cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms and causality remain poorly understood1\textendash 3. A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) lack canonical kinase mutations but instead have succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficiency and global DNA hyper-methylation4,5. Here we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in genome topology that activate oncogenic programs. To investigate epigenetic alterations systematically, we mapped DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers, and chromosome topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant, and SDH-deficient GISTs. Although these respective subtypes shared similar enhancer landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We focused on a disrupted insulator that normally partitions a core GIST super-enhancer from the FGF4 oncogene. Recurrent loss of this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs, allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancer and oncogene. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF motifs in an SDH-intact GIST model disrupted the boundary and strongly up-regulated FGF4 expression. We also identified a second recurrent insulator loss event near the KIT oncogene, which is also highly expressed across SDH-deficient GISTs. Finally, we established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from an SDH-deficient GIST that faithfully maintains the epigenetics of the parental tumor, including hyper-methylation and insulator defects. This PDX model is highly sensitive to FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, and more so to combined FGFR and KIT inhibition, validating the functional significance of the underlying epigenetic lesions. Our study reveals how epigenetic alterations can drive oncogenic programs in the absence of canonical kinase mutations, with implications for mechanistic targeting of aberrant pathways in cancers.},

However, this conclusion is largely drawn from the observation that promoter DNA methylation inversely correlates with gene expression in natural conditions. The effect of induced DNA methylation on endogenous promoters has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Here, we induced the simultaneous methylation of thousands of promoters in the genome of human cells using an engineered zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein, enabling assessment of the effect of forced DNA methylation upon transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation persistence after the removal of the fusion protein. We find that DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to transcriptionally repress promoters. Furthermore, DNA methylation deposited at promoter regions associated with H3K4me3 is rapidly erased after removal of the zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein. Finally, we demonstrate that induced DNA methylation can exist simultaneously on promoter nucleosomes that possess the active histone modification H3K4me3, or DNA bound by the initiated form of RNA polymerase II. These findings suggest that promoter DNA methylation is not generally sufficient for transcriptional inactivation, with implications for the emerging field of epigenome engineering.},

These compartments are cell-type specific and are associated with open and closed chromatin. We show that A/B compartments can reliably be estimated using epigenetic data from several different platforms: the Illumina 450 k DNA methylation microarray, DNase hypersensitivity sequencing, single-cell ATAC sequencing and single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We do this by exploiting that the structure of long-range correlations differs between open and closed compartments.

  abstract = {The whys and wherefores of SciSci The science of science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of science\textemdash from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field. In a Review, Fortunato et al. explain that the underlying rationale is that with a deeper understanding of the precursors of impactful science, it will be possible to develop systems and policies that improve each scientist's ability to succeed and enhance the prospects of science as a whole. Science, this issue p. eaao0185 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDThe increasing availability of digital data on scholarly inputs and outputs\textemdash from research funding, productivity, and collaboration to paper citations and scientist mobility\textemdash offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the structure and evolution of science. The science of science (SciSci) offers a quantitative understanding of the interactions among scientific agents across diverse geographic and temporal scales: It provides insights into the conditions underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific discovery, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and policies that have the potential to accelerate science. In the past decade, SciSci has benefited from an influx of natural, computational, and social scientists who together have developed big data\textendash based capabilities for empirical analysis and generative modeling that capture the unfolding of science, its institutions, and its workforce. The value proposition of SciSci is that with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive successful science, we can more effectively address environmental, societal, and technological problems. ADVANCESScience can be described as a complex, self-organizing, and evolving network of scholars, projects, papers, and ideas. This representation has unveiled patterns characterizing the emergence of new scientific fields through the study of collaboration networks and the path of impactful discoveries through the study of citation networks. Microscopic models have traced the dynamics of citation accumulation, allowing us to predict the future impact of individual papers. SciSci has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and the scientific horizon. For example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become more likely to make major breakthroughs. Overall, the highest-impact science is grounded in conventional combinations of prior work but features unusual combinations. Last, as the locus of research is shifting into teams, SciSci is increasingly focused on the impact of team research, finding that small teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact. OUTLOOKSciSci offers a deep quantitative understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas because it facilitates the identification of fundamental mechanisms responsible for scientific discovery. These interdisciplinary data-driven efforts complement contributions from related fields such as scientometrics and the economics and sociology of science. Although SciSci seeks long-standing universal laws and mechanisms that apply across various fields of science, a fundamental challenge going forward is accounting for undeniable differences in culture, habits, and preferences between different fields and countries. This variation makes some cross-domain insights difficult to appreciate and associated science policies difficult to implement. The differences among the questions, data, and skills specific to each discipline suggest that further insights can be gained from domain-specific SciSci studies, which model and identify opportunities adapted to the needs of individual research fields. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/359/6379/eaao0185/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The complexity of science.Science can be seen as an expanding and evolving network of ideas, scholars, and papers. SciSci searches for universal and domain-specific laws underlying the structure and dynamics of science.ILLUSTRATION: NICOLE SAMAY Identifying fundamental drivers of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution are instrumental for the design of policies that can improve the scientific enterprise\textemdash for example, through enhanced career paths for scientists, better performance evaluation for organizations hosting research, discovery of novel effective funding vehicles, and even identification of promising regions along the scientific frontier. The science of science uses large-scale data on the production of science to search for universal and domain-specific patterns. Here, we review recent developments in this transdisciplinary field.},

Similar to genetic mutations, alterations in epigenetic regulation can lead to uncontrolled cell division, tumor initiation and growth, invasiveness and metastasis. Research in brain cancer, particularly gliomas, has uncovered global and gene-specific DNA hypomethylation, local DNA hypermethylation of gene promoters and the de-regulation of microRNA expression. Understanding epigenetic dysregulation in brain cancers has provided new tools for prognostication, as well as suggesting new approaches to therapy. There is significant interest in new sequencing-based technologies that map genetic and epigenetic alterations comprehensively and at high resolution. These methods are being applied to brain tumors, and will better define the contribution of epigenetic defects to tumorigenesis.},

The methylation status of cytosines in CpGs and occasionally in non-CpG cytosines influences protein-DNA interactions, gene expression, and chromatin structure and stability. The degree of DNA methylation at particular loci may be heritable transgenerationally and may be altered by environmental exposures and diet, potentially contributing to the development of human diseases. For the vast majority of normal and disease methylomes however, less than 1\% of the CpGs have been assessed, revealing the formative stage of methylation mapping techniques. Thus, there is significant discovery potential in new genome-scale platforms applied to methylome mapping, particularly oligonucleotide arrays and the transformative technology of next-generation sequencing. Here, we outline the currently used methylation detection reagents and their application to microarray and sequencing platforms. A comparison of the emerging methods is presented, highlighting their degrees of technical complexity, methylome coverage and precision in resolving methylation. Because there are hundreds of unique methylomes to map within one individual and interindividual variation is likely to be significant, international coordination is essential to standardize methylome platforms and to create a full repository of methylome maps from tissues and unique cell types.},

Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.},

TADs have internal substructures that are often cell type specific, but their higher-order organization remains elusive. Here, we investigate TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes. Using polymer modelling, we demonstrate that hierarchical folding promotes efficient chromatin packaging without the loss of contact specificity, highlighting a role far beyond the simple need for packing efficiency.},

In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4\textendash 10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12\textendash 16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36~million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown~significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.},

  abstract = {In science, the relationship between methods and discovery is symbiotic. As we discover more, we are able to construct more precise and sensitive tools and methods that enable further dis-covery. With better lens crafting came microscopes, and with them the discovery of living cells. In the last 40 years, advances in molecular biology, statistics, and computer science have ush-ered in the field of bioinformatics and the genomic era. Computational scientists enjoy developing new methods, and the community encourages them to do so. Indeed, the editorial guidelines for PLOS Computational Biology require manu-scripts to apply novel methods. However, it is often confusing to know which method to choose: which method is best? And, in this context, what does " best " mean? To help choose an appropriate method for a particular task, scientists often form communi-ty-based challenges for the unbiased evaluation of methods in a given field. These challenges help evaluate existing and novel methods, while helping to coalesce a community and leading to new ideas and collaborations. In computational biology, the first of these challenges was arguably the Critical Assess-ment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP [1], whose goal is to evaluate methods for pre-dicting three-dimensional protein structure from amino acid sequence. The first CASP meeting was held in December of 1994, following a " prediction period " where members of the community were presented with protein amino acid sequences and asked to predict their three dimensional structures. The sequences that were chosen had recently been solved by X-ray crystallography but had not been not published or released until after the predictions from the community were made. Since the first CASP, we have seen many successful chal-lenges, including Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) for protein function prediction [2], Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) (for genome interpreta-tion) [3], Critical Assessment of Massive (originally " Microarray ") Data Analysis (CAMDA) (for large-scale biological data) [4], BioCreative (for biomedical text mining) [5], the Assem-blathon (for sequence assembly), and the NCI-DREAM Challenges (for various biomedical challenges), amongst others [6]. Computational challenges also help solve new problems. While the original CASP experi-ment was developed to evaluate existing methods applied to current problems, other commu-nities often look at other areas for which there are no existing tools. These challenges have spread successfully to industry, and companies such as Innocentive [7] and X-Prize [8] offer large prizes for solving novel questions.},

We discuss predictions from our polymer models of loop extrusion with barrier elements and review recent experimental studies that provide strong support for loop extrusion, focusing on perturbations to CTCF and cohesin assayed via Hi-C in interphase. Finally, we discuss a likely molecular mechanism of loop extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes.},

Induced FOXA1 triggers oncogenic gene signatures and proteomic profiles highly associated with endocrine resistance. Integrated omics data reveal               IL8               as one of the most perturbed genes regulated by FOXA1 and ER transcriptional reprogramming in Endo-R cells. IL-8 knockdown inhibits tamoxifen-resistant cell growth and invasion and partially attenuates the effect of overexpressed FOXA1.

  abstract = {Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer factor that facilitates chromatin binding and function of lineage-specific and oncogenic transcription factors. Hyperactive FOXA1 signaling due to gene amplification or overexpression has been reported in estrogen receptor-positive (ER               +               ) endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FOXA1 up-regulation promotes these processes and the key downstream targets of the FOXA1 oncogenic network remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that FOXA1 overexpression in ER               +               breast cancer cells drives genome-wide enhancer reprogramming to activate prometastatic transcriptional programs. Up-regulated FOXA1 employs superenhancers (SEs) to synchronize transcriptional reprogramming in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, reflecting an early embryonic development process. We identify the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-2{$\alpha$} (HIF-2{$\alpha$}) as the top high FOXA1-induced SE target, mediating the impact of high FOXA1 in activating prometastatic gene sets and pathways associated with poor clinical outcome. Using clinical ER               +               /HER2               -               metastatic breast cancer datasets, we show that the aberrant FOXA1/HIF-2{$\alpha$} transcriptional axis is largely nonconcurrent with the               ESR1               mutations, suggesting different mechanisms of endocrine resistance and treatment strategies. We further demonstrate the selective efficacy of an HIF-2{$\alpha$} antagonist, currently in clinical trials for advanced kidney cancer and recurrent glioblastoma, in reducing the clonogenicity, migration, and invasion of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells expressing high FOXA1. Our study has uncovered high FOXA1-induced enhancer reprogramming and HIF-2{$\alpha$}\textendash dependent transcriptional programs as vulnerable targets for treating endocrine-resistant and metastatic breast cancer.},

Such enhancers can map quite far\textemdash one megabase or more\textemdash from the genes they regulate. How remote enhancers relay regulatory information to their target promoters is one of the central mysteries of genome organization and function. A variety of contrasting mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including enhancer tracking, linking, looping, and mobilization to transcription factories. We argue that extreme versions of these mechanisms cannot account for the transcriptional dynamics and precision seen in living cells, tissues, and embryos. We describe emerging evidence for dynamic three-dimensional hubs that combine different elements of the classical models.},

  abstract = {Genetic and epigenetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity cooperate to shape the evolutionary course of cancer1. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic diversification and evolution after therapy2,3. The CLL epigenome is also an important disease-defining feature4,5, and growing populations of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA methylation known as epimutations6. However, previous studies using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation rate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed that the common clonal origin of CLL results in a consistently increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages across the trajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this directly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant transformation and a greater proliferative history. Integration of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of epimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node after treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles. The single-cell integration of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional information thus charts the lineage history of CLL and its evolution with therapy.},

We directly visualized the formation and processive extension of DNA loops by yeast condensin in real time. Our findings constitute unambiguous evidence for loop extrusion. We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Condensin-induced loop extrusion was strictly asymmetric, which demonstrates that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Active DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of promoter-associated cystosine-guanine (CpG) islands is an epigenetic modification of DNA frequently observed in adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This epigenetic modification has been associated with gene silencing, malignant transformation, and aging. It is not known whether there are epigenetic differences between pediatric patients and adult patients with ALL. METHODS: To investigate the methylation characteristics of pediatric patients with ALL and to determine whether DNA methylation can explain prognostic or biologic differences between pediatric and adult patients, the authors analyzed the methylation status of 7 promoter-associated CpG islands in 16 pediatric patients with ALL and compared them with the methylation characteristics of a cohort of adult patients with ALL. The genes analyzed included the estrogen receptor gene (ER), multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), p15, C-ABL, CD10, p16, and p73. RESULTS: The mean methylation densities of ER, MDR1, CD10, p15, and C-ABL were 25.4\%, 16.4\%, 5.23\%, 4.24\%, and 4\%, respectively. P16 was methylated in 11.7\% of patients, and p73 was methylated in 17.6\% of patients. One patient (6.2\%) had methylation of 0 genes, 15 patients (93.7\%) had methylation of {$>$}/= 1 gene, and 4 patients (25\%) had methylation of 3-4 genes. Methylation of all these genes was {$<$} 2\% (or methylation specific polymerase chain reaction negative) in nonneoplastic tissues. A significant inverse correlation was observed between methylation of CD10 and CD10 expression. No differences were observed between the methylation characteristics of pediatric patients and adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that DNA methylation is common in pediatric patients with ALL and that methylation of the genes studied does not account for prognostic differences between pediatric patients and adult patients with ALL.},

The objective of this study was to define the methylation characteristics of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using bisulfite-PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion (COBRA), we have analyzed the methylation status of 10 promoter-associated CpG islands in 80 untreated adult patients with ALL. RESULTS: Mean methylation density of MDR1, THBS2, MYF3, ER, p15, THBS1, CD10, C-ABL, and p16 was 24.5\%, 20.8\%, 17.6\%, 16.1\%, 11.3\%, 8.9\%, 4.5\%, 3.7\%, and 1.3\% respectively. p73 was methylated in 17 of 80 cases (21.2\%). A total of 86.2\% of the cases had methylation of at least one gene, and 42.5\% of the cases had methylation of three or more genes. MDR1 methylation was inversely correlated with age (P = 0.01). CD10 methylation inversely correlated with CD10 expression (P = 0.0001). Methylation of MDR1 and THBS1 was inversely associated with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, whereas C-ABL methylation correlated with the presence of the p210 variant of the Philadelphia chromosome. In univariate analysis, methylation of THBS1 was associated with a favorable outcome (P = 0.02), whereas methylation of p73, p15, and C-ABL was associated with a trend toward worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands is very common in adult ALL and potentially defines subgroups with distinct clinical and biological characteristics.},

However, the demand-adapted regulatory circuits of these early steps of hematopoiesis are largely unknown. Here we show that lysosomes, sophisticated nutrient-sensing and signaling centers, are regulated dichotomously by transcription factor EB (TFEB) and MYC to balance catabolic and anabolic processes required for activating LT-HSCs and guiding their lineage fate. TFEB-mediated induction of the endolysosomal pathway causes membrane receptor degradation, limiting LT-HSC metabolic and mitogenic activation, promoting quiescence and self-renewal, and governing erythroid-myeloid commitment. In contrast, MYC engages biosynthetic processes while repressing lysosomal catabolism, driving LT-HSC activation. Our study identifies TFEB-mediated control of lysosomal activity as a central regulatory hub for proper and coordinated stem cell fate determination.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {What to expect after a year in space Space is the final frontier for understanding how extreme environments affect human physiology. Following twin astronauts, one of which spent a year-long mission on the International Space Station, Garrett-Bakelman et al. examined molecular and physiological traits that may be affected by time in space (see the Perspective by L\"obrich and Jeggo). Sequencing the components of whole blood revealed that the length of telomeres, which is important to maintain in dividing cells and may be related to human aging, changed substantially during space flight and again upon return to Earth. Coupled with changes in DNA methylation in immune cells and cardiovascular and cognitive effects, this study provides a basis to assess the hazards of long-term space habitation. Science, this issue p. eaau8650; see also p. 127 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONTo date, 559 humans have been flown into space, but long-duration ({$>$}300 days) missions are rare (n = 8 total). Long-duration missions that will take humans to Mars and beyond are planned by public and private entities for the 2020s and 2030s; therefore, comprehensive studies are needed now to assess the impact of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, brain, and overall physiology. The space environment is made harsh and challenging by multiple factors, including confinement, isolation, and exposure to environmental stressors such as microgravity, radiation, and noise. The selection of one of a pair of monozygotic (identical) twin astronauts for NASA's first 1-year mission enabled us to compare the impact of the spaceflight environment on one twin to the simultaneous impact of the Earth environment on a genetically matched subject. RATIONALEThe known impacts of the spaceflight environment on human health and performance, physiology, and cellular and molecular processes are numerous and include bone density loss, effects on cognitive performance, microbial shifts, and alterations in gene regulation. However, previous studies collected very limited data, did not integrate simultaneous effects on multiple systems and data types in the same subject, or were restricted to 6-month missions. Measurement of the same variables in an astronaut on a year-long mission and in his Earth-bound twin indicated the biological measures that might be used to determine the effects of spaceflight. Presented here is an integrated longitudinal, multidimensional description of the effects of a 340-day mission onboard the International Space Station. RESULTSPhysiological, telomeric, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic, immune, microbiomic, cardiovascular, vision-related, and cognitive data were collected over 25 months. Some biological functions were not significantly affected by spaceflight, including the immune response (T cell receptor repertoire) to the first test of a vaccination in flight. However, significant changes in multiple data types were observed in association with the spaceflight period; the majority of these eventually returned to a preflight state within the time period of the study. These included changes in telomere length, gene regulation measured in both epigenetic and transcriptional data, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, subfoveal choroidal thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness, and serum metabolites. In addition, some factors were significantly affected by the stress of returning to Earth, including inflammation cytokines and immune response gene networks, as well as cognitive performance. For a few measures, persistent changes were observed even after 6 months on Earth, including some genes' expression levels, increased DNA damage from chromosomal inversions, increased numbers of short telomeres, and attenuated cognitive function. CONCLUSIONGiven that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight. The persistence of the molecular changes (e.g., gene expression) and the extrapolation of the identified risk factors for longer missions ({$>$}1 year) remain estimates and should be demonstrated with these measures in future astronauts. Finally, changes described in this study highlight pathways and mechanisms that may be vulnerable to spaceflight and may require safeguards for longer space missions; thus, they serve as a guide for targeted countermeasures or monitoring during future missions. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6436/eaau8650/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multidimensional, longitudinal assays of the NASA Twins Study.(Left and middle) Genetically identical twin subjects (ground and flight) were characterized across 10 generalized biomedical modalities before (preflight), during (inflight), and after flight (postflight) for a total of 25 months (circles indicate time points at which data were collected). (Right) Data were integrated to guide biomedical metrics across various ``-omes'' for future missions (concentric circles indicate, from inner to outer, cytokines, proteome, transcriptome, and methylome). To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress\textendash related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight. An integrated analysis reveals the changes, down to the molecular level, in one man during a year-long spaceflight.

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2011 the variant call format (VCF) has been widely adopted for processing DNA and RNA variants in practically all population studies \textemdash{} as well as in somatic and germline mutation studies. VCF can present single nucleotide variants, multi-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, and simple structural variants called against a reference genome. Here we present over 125 useful and much used free and open source software tools and libraries, part of vcflib tools and bio-vcf. We also highlight cyvcf2, hts-nim and slivar tools. Application is typically in the comparison, filtering, normalisation, smoothing, annotation, statistics, visualisation and exporting of variants. Our tools run daily and invisibly in pipelines and countless shell scripts. Our tools are part of a wider bioinformatics ecosystem and we consider it very important to make these tools available as free and open source software to all bioinformaticians so they can be deployed through software distributions, such as Debian, GNU Guix and Bioconda. vcflib, for example, was installed over 40,000 times and bio-vcf was installed over 15,000 times through Bioconda by December 2020. We shortly discuss the design of VCF, lessons learnt, and how we can address more complex variation that can not easily be represented by the VCF format. All source code is published under free and open source software licenses and can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/vcflib.},

  abstract = {Insulators are DNA sequence elements that help to prevent inappropriate interactions between adjacent regions of the genome. There are two types of insulator \textemdash{} one that is involved in enhancer-blocking activity and other that provides a barrier to the spread of heterochromatin \textemdash{} each with distinct functions, protein components and mechanisms.Enhancer-blocking insulators can prevent an enhancer from interacting with a promoter when placed between the two. This activity is position dependent; enhancer-blocking elements do not affect transcription from a flanking position.Enhancer-blocking activity in Drosophila and in vertebrates correlates with the ability of the insulator involved to anchor the chromatin fibre to a fixed nuclear structure, which leads to the formation of looped domains within the nucleus. Proposed models link enhancer-blocking activity either to the topological constraints of looped chromatin domains or to some specialized property of the nucleoprotein complex at the anchoring sites.Topology-based models hypothesize that some aspect of transcriptional activation is sensitive to nuclear architecture: it favours intra-loop interactions over inter-loop interactions. By placing an enhancer and promoter into separate loops, enhancer-blocking insulators reduce the chance of communication between the two.Enhancer-blocking models that focus on the anchoring complex are linked to the idea that enhancers function by sending an activating signal towards the promoter that tracks along the DNA (for example, an advancing polymerase or helicase), with which the insulator structure interferes.CTCF, a protein component of vertebrate enhancer-blocking insulators, has an important regulatory role at certain imprinted genes and elsewhere in the genome.The phenomenon of enhancer-blocking insulation might reflect a more general role of proteins like CTCF in helping to organize large-scale chromatin interactions within the nucleus, in some cases perhaps to facilitate rather than inhibit gene expression.Barrier insulators protect transgenes against chromatin-mediated silencing.Barrier insulators work by altering the local balance of chromatin components in a way that favours the formation of 'active' euchromatin and/or prevents the spread of 'silenced' heterochromatic structures. Barriers achieve this by increasing the local concentration of factors that promote euchromatin formation either by direct recruitment or by tethering the insulator site to a subnuclear compartment that is rich in these factors.Transition between euchromatin and heterochromatin is sharp only when a stably heterochromatic region is juxtaposed to a sequence element that can maintain itself in a euchromatic state (a barrier insulator). In all other cases the transition seems gradual at the population level as it happens at different positions in individual cells depending on the cell-specific local balance of chromatin components.Barrier insulators seem to be specialized variants of other transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers and locus-control regions, and are based on similar principles of action and protein components.},

However, Wood, Kressel, Joshi, and Louie (2014) claimed an absence of compelling support for this hypothesis and asserted that the few significant cycle shifts they observed were false positives resulting from publication bias, p-hacking, or other research artifacts. How could 2 meta-analyses of the same literature reach such different conclusions? We reanalyzed the data compiled by Wood et al. These analyses revealed problems in Wood et al.'s meta-analysis\textemdash some of which are reproduced in Wood and Carden's (2014) comment in the current issue of this journal\textemdash that led them to overlook clear evidence for the ovulatory shift hypothesis in their own set of effects. In addition, we present right-skewed p-curves that directly contradict speculations by Wood et al.; Wood and Carden; and Harris, Pashler, and Mickes (2014) that supportive findings in the cycle shift literature are false positives. Therefore, evidence from both of the meta-analyses and the p-curves strongly supports genuine, robust effects consistent with the ovulatory shift hypothesis and contradicts claims that these effects merely reflect publication bias, p-hacking, or other research artifacts. Unfounded speculations about p-hacking distort the research record and risk unfairly damaging researchers' reputations; they should therefore be made only on the basis of firm evidence. Keywords:},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancers arise from multiple acquired mutations, which presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer development might be present years before cancers become clinically apparent.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We analyzed data from whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10\% of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1\% of those younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95\% confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42\% of hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the earlier clones.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is increasingly common as people age, and is associated with increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations may represent characteristic early events in the development of hematologic cancers.

Here, we describe a population-genetic model subject to environmentally-induced epigenetic effects in order to investigate the conditions under which an epigenetically modifiable allele (epiallele) can invade a population insensitive to such cues. Here, epigenetically modifiable individuals have the potential to develop a phenotype that is suitable for their predicted future environment and, provided this prediction is correct, possess a biological advantage compared to their non-modifiable counterpart. However, when individuals experience an environment that 'mismatches' their phenotype, an advantage over unmodifiable individuals may be precluded and instead they experience a decrease in fitness. These epigenetic modifications are then inherited by the next generation which are either epigenetically reset to match their environment or, by resisting environmental cues, maintain their epigenetic status. We found that when environmental cues were common, a severe fitness cost of mismatch between environment and phenotype meant that the disadvantage was too costly and epialleles were less likely to invade. Moreover, for a wide range of parameters, a higher rate of germline epigenetic resetting decreased the likelihood of epiallele invasion. Accordingly, we found that both the frequency of environmental influences and the rate of resetting were central parameters in this system. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Paramutation involves an interaction between homologous alleles resulting in a heritable change in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Initially believed to be restricted to plants, paramutation has recently been observed in animal models, and a paramutation-like event has been noted in humans. Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting that trans-acting epigenetic effects can be inherited transgenerationally and therefore generate non-genomic phenotypic variation, these effects have been largely ignored in the context of evolutionary theory. The model presented here incorporates paramutation into the standard model of viability selection at one locus and demonstrates that paramutation can create long-term biological diversity in the absence of genetic change, and even in the absence of the original paramutagenic allele. Therefore, if paramutation is present, attributing evolution to only a traditional genetic model may fail to encompass the broad scope of phenotypic differences observed in nature. Moreover, we show also that an unusual mathematical behaviour, analogous to "Ewens' gap" of the two-locus two-allele symmetric-selection model, occurs: when the rate of one parameter-for example, the rate of paramutation-is increased, a pair of equilibria may disappear only to reappear as this parameter increases further. In summary, by incorporating even the simplest epigenetic parameters into the standard population-genetic model of selection, we show how this type of inheritance system can profoundly alter the course of evolution. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Differences in transgenerational epigenetic stability can result in a diversity of phenotypes among genetically identical individuals. Here we present a model that encapsulates non-genomic phenotypic variation in a population over two distinct environments that each act as a stimulus for epigenetic modification. By allowing different levels of epigenetic resetting, thereby increasing epigenetic diversity, we explore the dynamics of multiple epiallelic states subject to selection in a population-epigenetic model. We find that both epigenetic resetting and the environmental frequency are crucial parameters in this system. Our results illustrate the regions of parameter space that enable up to three equilibria to be simultaneously locally stable. Furthermore, it is clear that both continued environmental induction and epigenetic resetting prevent epigenetic fixation, maintaining phenotypic variation through different epiallelic states. However, unless both environments are reasonably common, levels of epigenetically-maintained variation are low. We argue that it is vital that non-genomic phenotypic diversity is not ignored in evolutionary theory, but instead regarded as distinct epiallelic variants. Ultimately, a critical goal of future experiments should be to determine accurate rates of epigenetic resetting, especially over several generations, in order to establish the long-term significance of epigenetic inheritance. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods to reliably define tumour cell of origin from primary, bulk tumour cell samples has been a challenge. Here we use a well-defined model of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to demonstrate that transforming haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors results in more aggressive AML than transforming committed progenitor cells. Transcriptome profiling reveals a gene expression signature broadly distinguishing stem cell-derived versus progenitor cell-derived AML, including genes involved in immune escape, extravasation and small GTPase signal transduction. However, whole-genome profiling of open chromatin reveals precise and robust biomarkers reflecting each cell of origin tested, from bulk AML tumour cell sampling. We find that bulk AML tumour cells exhibit distinct open chromatin loci that reflect the transformed cell of origin and suggest that open chromatin patterns may be leveraged as prognostic signatures in human AML.},

Existing epigenetic studies omit unassembled and unmappable genomic regions             (e.g             . centromeres, pericentromeres, acrocentric chromosome arms, subtelomeres, segmental duplications, tandem repeats). Leveraging the new assembly, we were able to measure enrichment of epigenetic marks with short reads using k-mer assisted mapping methods. This granted array-level enrichment information to characterize the epigenetic regulation of these satellite repeats. Using nanopore sequencing data, we generated base level maps of the most complete human methylome ever produced. We examined methylation patterns in satellite DNA and revealed organized patterns of methylation along individual molecules. When exploring the centromeric epigenome, we discovered a distinctive dip in centromere methylation consistent with active sites of kinetochore assembly. Through long-read chromatin accessibility measurements (nanoNOMe) paired to CUT\&RUN data, we found the hypomethylated region was extremely inaccessible and paired to CENP-A/B binding. With long-reads we interrogated allele-specific, longrange epigenetic patterns in complex macro-satellite arrays such as those involved in X chromosome inactivation. Using the single molecule measurements we can clustered reads based on methylation status alone distinguishing epigenetically heterogeneous and homogeneous areas. The analysis provides a framework to investigate the most elusive regions of the human genome, applying both long and short-read technology to grant new insights into epigenetic regulation.},

  abstract = {Replication is essential for building confidence in research studies1, yet it is still the exception rather than the rule2,3. That is not necessarily because funding is unavailable \textemdash{} it is because the current system makes original authors and replicators antagonists. Focusing on the fields of economics, political science, sociology and psychology, in which ready access to raw data and software code are crucial to replication efforts, we survey deficiencies in the current system. We propose reforms that can both encourage and reinforce better behaviour \textemdash{} a system in which authors feel that replication of software code is both probable and fair, and in which less time and effort is required for replication. Current incentives for replication attempts reward those efforts that overturn the original results. In fact, in the 11 top-tier economics journals we surveyed, we could find only 11 replication studies \textemdash{} in this case, defined as reanalyses using the same data sets \textemdash{} published since 2011. All claimed to refute the original results. We also surveyed 88 editors and co-editors from these 11 journals. All editors who replied (35 in total, including at least one from each journal) said they would, in principle, publish a replication study that overturned the results of an original study. Only nine of the respondents said that they would consider publishing a replication study that confirmed the original results. We also personally experienced antagonism between replicators and authors in a programme sponsored by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), a non-governmental organization that actively funds software-code replication. We participated as authors of original studies (P.G. and S.G.) and as the chair of 3ie's board of directors (P.G.). In our experience, the programme worked liked this: 3ie selected influential papers to be replicated and then held an open competition, awarding approximately US\$25,000 for the replication of each study4. The organization also offered the original authors the opportunity to review and comment on the replications. Of 27 studies commissioned, 20 were completed, and 7 (35\%) reported that they were unable to fully replicate the results in the original article. The only replication published in a peer-reviewed journal5 claimed to refute the results of the original paper. Despite 3ie's best efforts, adversarial relationships developed between original and replication researchers. Original authors of five of the seven non-replicated studies wrote in public comments that the replications actively sought to refute their results and were nitpicking. One group stated that the incentives of replicators to publish ``could lead to overstatement of the magnitude of criticism'' (see go.nature.com/2gecz3b). Others made similar points. Although one effort replicated all the results in the original paper, the originating authors wrote, ``we disagree with the unnecessarily aggressive tone of some statements in the replication report (particularly in the abstract)'' (see go.nature.com/2esdjkr). Another group felt that ``the statement that our original conclusions were robust was buried''(see go.nature.com/2siufet). The 3ie-sponsored replication5 of one highly cited paper6 resulted in an acrimonious debate that became known as the Worm Wars. Several independent scholars speculated that assumptions made by the replicators had more to do with overturning results than with any scientific justification. Replication costs A first step to getting more replications is making them easier. This could be done by requiring authors to publicly post the data and code used to produce the results in their studies \textemdash{} although this in itself would not redress the incentive to gain a publication by overturning results. Ready access to data and code would ease replication attempts. In our survey of journal websites, the mid-tier economics journals (as ranked by impact factor) and those in sociology and psychology rarely asked for these resources to be made available. By contrast, almost all of the top-tier journals in economics have policies that require software code and data to be made available to editors before publication. This is also true of most of the political-science journals we assessed, and all three of the broad science journals in our survey (see Supplementary information). In addition, many of the top-tier economics journals explicitly ask authors to post raw data as well as estimation data \textemdash{} the final data set used to produce the results after data clean-up and manipulation of variables. These are usually placed on a publicly accessible website that is designated or maintained by the journal. There seems to be no such norm in psychology and sociology journals (see `Data checked?'). ￼ Source: P. Gertler, S. Galiani \& M. Romero (unpublished data)},

  abstract = {To make good judgments people gather information. An important problem an agent needs to solve is when to continue sampling data and when to stop gathering evidence. We examine whether and how the desire to hold a certain belief influences the amount of information participants require to form that belief. Participants completed a sequential sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. While one state was better than the other, participants had no control over which they were in, and to maximize rewards they had to maximize accuracy. Results show that participants' judgments were biased towards believing they were in the desirable state. They required a smaller proportion of supporting evidence to reach that conclusion and ceased gathering samples earlier when reaching the desirable conclusion. The findings were replicated in an additional sample of participants. To examine how this behavior was generated we modeled the data using a drift-diffusion model. This enabled us to assess two potential mechanisms which could be underlying the behavior: (i) a valence-dependent response bias and/or (ii) a valence-dependent process bias. We found that a valence-dependent model, with both a response bias and a process bias, fit the data better than a range of other alternatives, including valence-independent models and models with only a response or process bias. Moreover, the valence-dependent model provided better out-of-sample prediction accuracy than the valence-independent model. Our results provide an account for how the motivation to hold a certain belief decreases the need for supporting evidence. The findings also highlight the advantage of incorporating valence into evidence accumulation models to better explain and predict behavior.},

However, differentiating driver and passenger events among non-coding genetic variants remains a challenge to understand the etiology of cancer and inform the delivery of personalized cancer medicine. Herein, we reveal an enrichment of non-coding mutations in cis-regulatory elements that cover a subset of transcription factors linked to tumor progression in luminal breast cancers. Using a cohort of 26 primary luminal ER+PR+ breast tumors, we compiled a catalogue of \textasciitilde 100,000 unique cis-regulatory elements from ATACseq data. Integrating this catalogue with somatic mutations from 350 publicly available breast tumor whole genomes, we identified four recurrently mutated individual cis-regulatory elements. By then partitioning the non-coding genome into cistromes, defined as the sum of binding sites for a transcription factor, we uncovered cancer driver cistromes for ten transcription factors in luminal breast cancer, namely CTCF, ELF1, ESR1, FOSL2, FOXA1, FOXM1 GATA3, JUND, TFAP2A, and TFAP2C in luminal breast cancer. Nine of these ten transcription factors were shown to be essential for growth in breast cancer, with four exclusive to the luminal subtype. Collectively, we present a strategy to find cancer driver cistromes relying on quantifying the enrichment of non-coding mutations over cis-regulatory elements concatenated into a functional unit drawn from an accessible chromatin catalogue derived from primary cancer tissues.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an essential process for the development of mammals. Its abnormal distribution, particularly at the level of the repeated regions of the genome, is a pathological signature. The discovery of hereditary diseases affecting DNA methylation and the stability of the genome allowed a considerable progress in the identification of their actors and mechanisms. We chose to study the ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability and Facial Abnormalities) syndrome, the first genetic disorder identified with defects in the distribution of DNA methylation, linked to chromosomal instability. When I started my PhD, mutations in two genes had been described to cause the ICF syndrome: DNMT3B and ZBTB24. However, the genetic origin of a subset of ICF patients remained unknown. We identified mutations in CDCA7 and HELLS as causative of the ICF syndrome. I showed that their loss of function in somatic cells results in the loss of DNA methylation at centromeric repeats, strongly suggestive of a role DNA methylation maintenance. Hence, the study of the aetiology of a genetic disease provided new candidate ``guardians'' of DNA repeats and genome stability, with virtually unknown functions but with exciting potential roles in the DNA methylation machinery and in development. During my PhD, I established methylation maps in ICF patients cells to identify common and distinct targets of these factors, as well as their genomic and epigenomic characteristics. In contrast to DNMT3B mutations, those in ZBTB24, CDCA7 and HELLS affect methylation at CpG-poor regions in intergenic genomic locations and at interspersed DNA repeats, and more generally, at genomic locations with heterochromatic features. Their integrity is required for the methylated status of coding and non-coding clusters of genes, some of which are expressed in a monoallelic manner. To better characterize the role of ZBTB24 in development and DNA methylation pathways, we generated a mouse model carrying mutations in ZBTB24. We showed that ZBTB24 is essential for early development, while it seemed to be dispensable for in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells. We implicated ZBTB24 in the establishment of DNA methylation at DNA repeats, both in tandem or interspersed, in differentiating ES cells. Interestingly, ZBTB24 seems to be also implicated in the establishment of the repressive mark H3K9me3 suggesting that ZBTB24 may indirectly control DNA methylation through an interplay with histone marks. As a whole, our work sheds light on how DNA methylation and heterochromatin marks are established and maintained at unique genes and DNA repeats, and provides new actors and mechanisms to consider in studies of the maintenance of genome stability.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 200 prostate cancer (PrCa) risk regions, which provide potential insights into causal mechanisms. Multiple lines of evidence show that a significant proportion of PrCa risk can be explained by germline causal variants that dysregulate nearby target genes in prostate-relevant tissues, thus altering disease risk. The traditional approach to explore this hypothesis has been correlating GWAS variants with steady-state transcript levels, referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In this work, we assess the utility of chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) to identify target genes for PrCa GWAS risk loci. We find that interactome data confirm previously reported PrCa target genes identified through GWAS/eQTL overlap (e.g., MLPH). Interestingly, HiChIP identifies links between PrCa GWAS variants and genes well-known to play a role in prostate cancer biology (e.g., AR) that are not detected by eQTL-based methods. HiChIP predicted enhancer elements at the AR and NKX3-1 prostate cancer risk loci, and both were experimentally confirmed to regulate expression of the corresponding genes through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbation in LNCaP cells. Our results demonstrate that looping data harbor additional information beyond eQTLs and expand the number of PrCa GWAS loci that can be linked to candidate susceptibility genes.},

  abstract = {Tracking mitotic chromosome formation How cells pack DNA into fully compact, rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis has fascinated cell biologists for more than a century. Gibcus et al. delineated the conformational transition trajectory from interphase chromatin to mitotic chromosomes minute by minute during the cell cycle. The mitotic chromosome is organized in a spiral staircase architecture in which chromatin loops emanate radially from a centrally located helical scaffold. The molecular machines condensin I and II play distinct roles in these processes: Condensin II is essential for helical winding, whereas condensin I modulates the organization within each helical turn. Science, this issue p. eaao6135 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONDuring mitosis, cells compact their chromosomes into dense rod-shaped structures to ensure their reliable transmission to daughter cells. Our work explores how cells achieve this compaction. We integrate genetic, genomic, and computational approaches to characterize the key steps in mitotic chromosome formation from the G2 nucleus to metaphase, and we identify roles of specific molecular machines, condensin I and II, in these major conformational transitions. RATIONALEWe used chicken DT-40 cells expressing an analog-sensitive CDK1 to produce cell cultures that synchronously enter mitosis. We collected cells at key time points during mitotic entry; analyzed chromosome organization by microscopy, chromosome conformation capture, and polymer simulations; and delineated a pathway of mitotic chromosome formation. We used engineered cell lines to study the function of condensin complexes, which are critical for mitotic chromosome formation. We fused condensin I and II subunits to plant auxin-inducible degron domains, thus enabling their rapid depletion in late G2 just before mitotic entry. These cell lines allowed us to determine the roles of condensin I and II in specific steps of the mitotic chromosome morphogenesis pathway. RESULTSOur analysis of G2 chromosomes reveals hallmarks of interphase chromosomes, including topologically associating domains and compartments. Upon entry into prophase, this organization is lost within minutes, and by late prophase, chromosomes are folded as arrays of consecutive loops condensed around a central axis. These loops project with random but mutually correlated angles from the axis. During prometaphase, the loop array undergoes two major reorganizations. First, it acquires a helical arrangement of loops. Polymer simulations of Hi-C data show that the centrally located axis acquires a helical twist so that consecutive loops emanate as the steps of a spiral staircase. Second, the chromatin loops become nested with \textasciitilde 400-kb outer loops split up by \textasciitilde 80-kb inner loops. As prometaphase proceeds, chromosomes shorten through progressive helical winding, with the numbers of loops per turn increasing. As a result, the size of a helical turn grows from \textasciitilde 3 Mb (\textasciitilde 40 loops) to \textasciitilde 12 Mb (\textasciitilde 150 loops). Depletion of condensin I or II before mitotic entry revealed their differing roles in mitotic chromosome formation. Either condensin can mediate loop array formation. However, condensin II is required for the helical twisting of the scaffold from which loops emanate, whereas condensin I modulates the size and arrangement of nested inner loops. CONCLUSIONWe describe a pathway of mitotic chromosome folding that unifies many previous observations. In prophase, condensins mediate the loss of interphase organization and the formation of arrays of consecutive loops. In prometaphase, chromosomes adopt a spiral staircase\textendash like structure with a helically arranged axial scaffold of condensin II at the bases of chromatin loops. The condensin II loops are further compacted by condensin I into clusters of smaller nested loops that are additionally collapsed by chromatin-to-chromatin attractions. The combination of nested loops distributed around a helically twisted axis plus dense chromatin packing achieves the 10,000-fold compaction of chromatin into linearly organized chromosomes that is required for accurate chromosome segregation when cells divide. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/359/6376/eaao6135/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A pathway for mitotic chromosome formation.In prophase, condensins mediate the loss of interphase chromosome conformation, and loop arrays are formed. In prometaphase, the combined action of condensin I (blue spheres in the bottom diagram) and II (red spheres) results in helically arranged nested loop arrays. Mitotic chromosomes fold as compact arrays of chromatin loops. To identify the pathway of mitotic chromosome formation, we combined imaging and Hi-C analysis of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations. Here we show that in prophase, the interphase organization is rapidly lost in a condensin-dependent manner, and arrays of consecutive 60-kilobase (kb) loops are formed. During prometaphase, \textasciitilde 80-kb inner loops are nested within \textasciitilde 400-kb outer loops. The loop array acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive loops emanating from a central ``spiral staircase'' condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to \textasciitilde 12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested loops form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical winding. Mitotic chromosome folding involves formation of increasingly compacted helically arranged nested loop arrays.

These and modern endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as the fungicide vinclozolin (VIN) perturb hormone signaling and lead to dysfunctions following prenatal exposures. Beyond direct exposures, transgenerational disease phenotypes can persist for multiple generations without subsequent exposure. The mechanisms of action of these EDCs differ: VIN is anti-androgenic while the PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) is weakly estrogenic. Based on limited evidence for the inheritance of epimutations in germline, we measured DNA methylation in brain and sperm of rats. Pregnant dams were exposed from day 8\textendash 18 of gestation to low dosages of VIN, A1221, or the vehicle. To produce paternal lineages, exposed F1 males were bred with untreated females, creating the F2 and subsequently F3 generations. In adult F1 and F3 males, mature sperm was collected, and brain nuclei involved in anxiety and social behaviors (CA3 of the hippocampus; central amygdala) were selected for assays of epimutations in CpG islands using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In F1 sperm, VIN and PCBs induced differential methylation in 215 and 284 CpG islands, respectively, compared to vehicle. The majority of effects were associated with hypermethylation. Fewer epimutations were detected in the brain. A subset of differentially methylated regions were retained from the F1 to the F3 generation, suggesting a common mechanism of EDC and germline epigenome interaction. Thus, EDCs can cause heritable epimutations in the sperm that may embody the future phenotype of brain-behavior disorders caused by direct or transgenerational exposures.},

Our method is based on linking unidirectional methylation changes to loss-of-function phenotypes. We tested performance by reconstructing Neanderthal and chimpanzee skeletal morphologies and obtained {$>$}85\% precision in identifying divergent traits. We then applied this method to the Denisovan and offer a putative morphological profile. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared with Neanderthals traits such as an elongated face and a wide pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an increased dental arch and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions match the only morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date, as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used to reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive in the fossil record.},

Cytosine methylation does not reinforce or replace ancestral gene regulation pathways but instead endows methylated genomes with the ability to repress specific promoters in a manner that is buffered against changes in the internal and external environment. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of de novo methylation depends on multiple inputs; these include the interaction of repeated sequences, local states of histone lysine methylation, small RNAs and components of the RNAi pathway, and divergent and catalytically inert cytosine methyltransferase homologues that have acquired regulatory roles. There are multiple families of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases in eukaryotes, and each family appears to be controlled by different regulatory inputs. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, which regulate most aspects of gene expression, do not appear to be involved in the establishment or maintenance of genomic methylation patterns.},

An importance sampling implementation of Monte Carlo expectation-maximization for likelihood inference is also discussed. The results illustrate a duality between approximate computation on exact data, and exact computation on approximate data. A cleverly designed inferential procedure exploits the alignment between the statistical tradeoff of privacy versus efficiency, and the computational tradeoff of approximation versus exactness, so that paying the cost of one gains the benefit of both.},

  abstract = {The prevailing paradigm for the analysis of biological data involves comparing groups of replicates from different conditions (e.g. control and treatment) to statistically infer features that discriminate them (e.g. differentially expressed genes). However, many situations in modern genomics such as single-cell omics experiments do not fit well into this paradigm because they lack true replicates. In such instances, spectral techniques could be used to rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure without the need to cluster samples. Here, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework for clustering-independent analysis. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score when restricted to graphs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with several applications to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Specifically, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate differentially expressed genes according to the topology of the expression space (e.g. alternative paths of differentiation). We also apply this formalism to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and to establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional studies. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches to the analysis of large-scale biological datasets.},

We demonstrate that the dynamic interplay between forward and backward epimutations is modulated by genomic context and show that subtle contextual differences have profoundly shaped patterns of methylation diversity in A. thaliana natural populations over evolutionary timescales. Theoretical arguments indicate that the epimutation rates reported here are high enough to rapidly uncouple genetic from epigenetic variation, but low enough for new epialleles to sustain long-term selection responses.

The loss of genomic stability and resulting gene alterations are key molecular pathogenic steps that occur early in tumorigenesis; they permit the acquisition of a suffi- cient number of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that transform cells and pro- mote tumor progression. Two predominant forms of genomic instability that have been identified in colon cancer are microsatellite instability and chromosome instability. Substantial progress has been made to identify causes of chromosomal instability in colorec- tal cells and to determine the effects of the different forms of genomic instability on the biological and clinical behavior of colon tumors. In addition to genomic instability, epigenetic instability results in the aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes. Determining the causes and roles of genomic and epigenomic instability in colon tumor formation has the potential to yield more effective prevention strat- egies and therapeutics for patients with colorectal cancer.},

These individuals harbour germline mutations in the gene encoding E-cadherin, CDH1, but their cancers have consistently demonstrated absence of loss of heterozygosity at the CDH1 locus.

We quantify these forces as intensive variables that can easily be compared between sequences, outline a computationally efficient transfer-matrix method for their calculation, and apply this method to influenza and HIV viruses. We find viruses altering their dinucleotide motif use under selective forces, with these forces on CpG dinucleotides growing stronger in influenza the longer it replicates in humans. For a subset of genes in the human genome, many involved in antiviral innate immunity, the forces acting on CpG dinucleotides are even greater than the forces observed in viruses, suggesting that both effects are in response to similar selective forces involving the innate immune system. We further find that the dynamics of entropic forces balancing selective forces can be used to predict how long it will take a virus to adapt to a new host, and that it would take H1N1 several centuries to adapt to humans from birds, typically contributing many of its synonymous substitutions to the forcible removal of CpG dinucleotides. By examining the probability landscape of dinucleotide motifs, we predict where motifs are likely to appear using only a single-force parameter and uncover the localization of UpU motifs in HIV. Essentially, we extend the natural language and concepts of statistical physics, such as entropy and conjugated forces, to understanding viral sequences and, more generally, constrained genome evolution.},

We here give detailed reasons and methods for reinterpreting statistics (including but not limited to) P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of observations with an entire set of analysis assumptions, rather than just a narrow target hypothesis. Such reinterpretations help avoid overconfident inferences whenever there is uncertainty about the assumptions used to derive and compute the statistical results. Examples of such assumptions include not only standard statistical modeling assumptions, but also assumptions about absence of systematic errors, protocol violations, and data corruption. Unconditional descriptions introduce uncertainty about such assumptions directly into statistical presentations of results, rather than leaving that only to the informal discussion that ensues. We thus view unconditional description as a vital component of good statistical training and presentation.},

We quantitatively interrogate these relationships by comparing Hi-C and molecular phenotype data across cell types and haplotypes. While chromatin loops consistently form across different cell types, they have subtle quantitative differences in contact frequency that are associated with larger changes in gene expression and H3K27ac. For the vast majority of loci with quantitative differences in contact frequency across haplotypes, the changes in magnitude are smaller than those across cell types; however, the proportional relationships between contact propensity, gene expression, and H3K27ac are consistent. These findings suggest that subtle changes in contact propensity have a biologically meaningful role in gene regulation and could be a mechanism by which regulatory genetic variants in loop anchors mediate effects on expression.},

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a heterogeneous class of tumours, represents approximately 85\% of all new lung cancer diagnoses. Tobacco smoking remains the main risk factor for developing this disease, but radon exposure and air pollution also have a role. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease owing to inadequate screening programmes and late onset of clinical symptoms; consequently, patients have a very poor prognosis. Several diagnostic approaches can be used for NSCLC, including X-ray, CT and PET imaging, and histological examination of tumour biopsies. Accurate staging of the cancer is required to determine the optimal management strategy, which includes surgery, radiochemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted approaches with anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors if tumours harbour oncogene mutations. Several of these driver mutations have been identified (for example, in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)), and therapy continues to advance to tackle acquired resistance problems. Also, palliative care has a central role in patient management and greatly improves quality of life. For an illustrated summary of this Primer, visit: http://go.nature.com/rWYFgg},

Treatment comprises local surgery, radiotherapy and polychemotherapy, which are associated with acute and chronic adverse effects that may compromise quality of life in survivors. Histologically, Ewing sarcomas are composed of small round cells expressing high levels of CD99. Genetically, they are characterized by balanced chromosomal translocations in which a member of the FET gene family is fused with an ETS transcription factor, with the most common fusion being EWSR1\textendash FLI1 (85\% of cases). Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 protein (EWSR1)\textendash Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) is a tumour-specific chimeric transcription factor (EWSR1\textendash FLI1) with neomorphic effects that massively rewires the transcriptome. Additionally, EWSR1\textendash FLI1 reprogrammes the epigenome by inducing de novo enhancers at GGAA microsatellites and by altering the state of gene regulatory elements, creating a unique epigenetic signature. Additional mutations at diagnosis are rare and mainly involve STAG2, TP53 and CDKN2A deletions. Emerging studies on the molecular mechanisms of Ewing sarcoma hold promise for improvements in early detection, disease monitoring, lower treatment-related toxicity, overall survival and quality of life.},

By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply StemID to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation.},

We herein describe the protocol for absolute quantification of chromatin architecture (AQuA)\textendash HiChIP, an advance that allows the absolute differences in protein-anchored chromatin interactions between samples to be determined. With our method, defined ratios of mouse and human fixed nuclei are mixed and subjected to endonuclease digestion. Chromatin contacts are captured by biotin-dATP incorporation and proximity ligation, followed by gentle shearing, ChIP, biotin capture and paired-end sequencing. 3D contacts are counted from paired-end tags (PETs) from the human genome and are normalized to the total PETs from the mouse genome. As orthogonal normalization allows observation of global changes, the approach will enable more quantitative insights into the topological determinants of transcriptional control and tissue-specific epigenetic memory. With our approach, we have discovered that rapid histone deacetylase inhibition disrupts super enhancer function by creating many new aberrant contacts. The code for data analysis is available at https://github.com/GryderArt/AQuA-HiChIP. This protocol reports both experimental and bioinformatic details to perform AQuA-HiChIP, going from cell culture to ranking chromatin interactions within 6 d.},

  abstract = {Megabase-scale intervals of active, gene-rich and inactive, gene-poor chromatin are known to segregate, forming the A and B compartments. Fine mapping of the contents of these A and B compartments has been hitherto impossible, owing to the extraordinary sequencing depths required to distinguish between the long-range contact patterns of individual loci, and to the computational complexity of the associated calculations. Here, we generate the largest published in situ Hi-C map to date, spanning 33 billion contacts. We also develop a computational method, dubbed PCA of Sparse, Super Massive Matrices (POSSUMM), that is capable of efficiently calculating eigenvectors for sparse matrices with millions of rows and columns. Applying POSSUMM to our Hi-C dataset makes it possible to assign loci to the A and B compartment at 500 bp resolution. We find that loci frequently alternate between compartments as one moves along the contour of the genome, such that the median compartment interval is only 12.5 kb long. Contrary to the findings in coarse-resolution compartment profiles, we find that individual genes are not uniformly positioned in either the A compartment or the B compartment. Instead, essentially all (95\%) active gene promoters localize in the A compartment, but the likelihood of localizing in the A compartment declines along the body of active genes, such that the transcriptional termini of long genes ({$>$}60 kb) tend to localize in the B compartment. Similarly, essentially all active enhancers elements (95\%) localize in the A compartment, even when the flanking sequences are comprised entirely of inactive chromatin and localize in the B compartment. These results are consistent with a model in which DNA-bound regulatory complexes give rise to phase separation at the scale of individual DNA elements.},

We show, using single-cell chromatin accessibility, that primary human GBMs harbor a heterogeneous self-renewing population whose diversity is captured in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In-depth characterization of chromatin accessibility in GSCs identifies three GSC states: Reactive, Constructive, and Invasive, each governed by uniquely essential transcription factors and present within GBMs in varying proportions. Orthotopic xenografts reveal that GSC states associate with survival, and identify an invasive GSC signature predictive of low patient survival, in line with the higher invasive properties of Invasive state GSCs compared to Reactive and Constructive GSCs as shown by in vitro and in vivo assays. Our chromatin-driven characterization of GSC states improves prognostic precision and identifies dependencies to guide combination therapies.},

We consider nine epigenomic and annotation features across 115 cell types and measure genomic function by using signatures of natural selection as a proxy. We measure information as the reduction in entropy under a probabilistic evolutionary model that describes genetic variation across \textasciitilde 50 diverse humans and several nonhuman primates. We find that several genomic features yield more information in combination than they do individually, with DNase-seq displaying particularly strong synergy. Most of the entropy in human genetic variation, by far, reflects mutation and neutral drift; the genome-wide reduction in entropy due to selection is equivalent to only a small fraction of the storage requirements of a single human genome. Based on this framework, we produce cell-type-specific maps of the probability that a mutation at each nucleotide will have fitness consequences (FitCons scores). These scores are predictive of known functional elements and disease-associated variants, they reveal relationships among cell types, and they suggest that \textasciitilde 8\% of nucleotide sites are constrained by natural selection.},

Here, we introduce HopLand, a pseudo-time recovery method using continuous Hopfield network to map cells to a Waddington's epigenetic landscape. It reveals from the single-cell data the combinatorial regulatory interactions among genes that control the dynamic progression through successive cell states. Results: We applied HopLand to different types of single-cell transcriptomic data. It achieved high accuracies of pseudotime prediction compared with existing methods. Moreover, a kinetic model can be extracted from each dataset. Through the analysis of such a model, we identified key genes and regulatory interactions driving the transition of cell states. Therefore, our method has the po-tential to generate fundamental insights into cell fate regulation.

We further evaluated the mechanism underlying the top hit, PCAT1, and found that a risk-associated variant at rs7463708 increases binding of ONECUT2, a novel androgen receptor (AR)-interacting transcription factor, at a distal enhancer that loops to the PCAT1 promoter, resulting in upregulation of PCAT1 upon prolonged androgen treatment. In addition, PCAT1 interacts with AR and LSD1 and is required for their recruitment to the enhancers of GNMT and DHCR24, two androgen late-response genes implicated in prostate cancer development and progression. PCAT1 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that modulating lncRNA expression is an important mechanism for risk-associated SNPs in promoting prostate transformation.},

These modifications enable scRRBS to provide digitized methylation information on approximately 1 million CpG sites within an individual diploid mouse or human cell at single-base resolution. Compared with the single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) technique, scRRBS covers fewer CpG sites, but it provides better coverage for CpG islands (CGIs), which are likely to be the most informative elements for DNA methylation. The entire procedure takes approximately 3 weeks, and it requires strong molecular biology skills.},

Understanding the lineage and differentiation state of each cell is fundamentally important for the ultimate delineation of organ formation and function. We developed SLICE, a novel algorithm that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to quantitatively measure cellular differentiation states based on single cell entropy and predict cell differentiation lineages via the construction of entropy directed cell trajectories. We validated our approach using three independent data sets with known lineage and developmental time information from both Homo sapiens and Mus musculus SLICE successfully measured the differentiation states of single cells and reconstructed cell differentiation trajectories that have been previously experimentally validated. We then applied SLICE to scRNA-seq of embryonic mouse lung at E16.5 to identify lung mesenchymal cell lineage relationships that currently remain poorly defined. A two-branched differentiation pathway of five fibroblastic subtypes was predicted using SLICE. The present study demonstrated the general applicability and high predictive accuracy of SLICE in determining cellular differentiation states and reconstructing cell differentiation lineages in scRNA-seq analysis.},

A variety of methods have been developed, and several have recently been advanced to genome-wide scale using arrays and next-generation sequencing approaches. We have previously reported reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), a bisulfite-based protocol that enriches CG-rich parts of the genome, thereby reducing the amount of sequencing required while capturing the majority of promoters and other relevant genomic regions. The approach provides single-nucleotide resolution, is highly sensitive and provides quantitative DNA methylation measurements. This protocol should enable any standard molecular biology laboratory to generate RRBS libraries of high quality. Briefly, purified genomic DNA is digested by the methylation-insensitive restriction enzyme MspI to generate short fragments that contain CpG dinucleotides at the ends. After end-repair, A-tailing and ligation to methylated Illumina adapters, the CpG-rich DNA fragments (40-220 bp) are size selected, subjected to bisulfite conversion, PCR amplified and end sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. Note that alignment and analysis of RRBS sequencing reads are not covered in this protocol. The extremely low input requirements (10-300 ng), the applicability of the protocol to formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples, and the technique's single-nucleotide resolution extends RRBS to a wide range of biological and clinical samples and research applications. The entire process of RRBS library construction takes {$\sim$}9 d.},

  abstract = {High-throughput genomic technologies have revealed a remarkably complex portrait of intratumor heterogeneity in cancer and have shown that tumors evolve through a reiterative process of genetic diversification and clonal selection. This discovery has challenged the classical paradigm of clonal dominance and brought attention to subclonal tumor cell populations that contribute to the cancer phenotype. Dynamic evolutionary models may explain how these populations grow within the ecosystem of tissues, including linear, branching, neutral, and punctuated patterns. Recent evidence in breast cancer favors branching and punctuated evolution driven by genome instability as well as nongenetic sources of heterogeneity, such as epigenetic variation, hierarchal tumor cell organization, and subclonal cell-cell interactions. Resolution of the full mutational landscape of tumors could help reconstruct their phylogenetic trees and trace the subclonal origins of therapeutic resistance, relapsed disease, and distant metastases, the major causes of cancer-related mortality. Real-time assessment of the tumor subclonal architecture, however, remains limited by the high rate of errors produced by most genome-wide sequencing methods as well as the practical difficulties associated with serial tumor genotyping in patients. This review focuses on novel approaches to mitigate these challenges using bulk tumor, liquid biopsies, single-cell analysis, and deep sequencing techniques. The origins of intratumor heterogeneity and the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic consequences in breast cancer are also explored. Mol Cancer Res; 15(9); 1127-37. \textcopyright 2017 AACR.},

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Pyrgo are "towers" of low-JCN duplications associated with early replicating regions and superenhancers, and are enriched in breast and ovarian cancers. Rigma comprise "chasms" of low-JCN deletions at late-replicating fragile sites in esophageal and other gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas. Tyfonas are "typhoons" of high-JCN junctions and fold back inversions that are enriched in acral but not cutaneous melanoma and associated with a previously uncharacterized mutational process of non-APOBEC kataegis. Clustering of tumors according to genome graph-derived features identifies subgroups associated with DNA repair defects and poor prognosis.},

Despite the importance and popularity of these algorithms, it is unclear to which extent their predictions are in agreement with actual measurements.                                         Results               We conduct the first independent evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 predictions. To this end, we collect data from eight SpCas9 off-target studies and compare them with the sites predicted by popular algorithms. We identify problems in one implementation but found that sequence-based off-target predictions are very reliable, identifying most off-targets with mutation rates superior to 0.1~\%, while the number of false positives can be largely reduced with a cutoff on the off-target score. We also evaluate on-target efficiency prediction algorithms against available datasets. The correlation between the predictions and the guide activity varied considerably, especially for zebrafish. Together with novel data from our labs, we find that the optimal on-target efficiency prediction model strongly depends on whether the guide RNA is expressed from a U6 promoter or transcribed in vitro. We further demonstrate that the best predictions can significantly reduce the time spent on guide screening.

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from 'regularized negative binomial regression', where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called-HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.},

In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations.

We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

In addition, 5hmC can be oxidized further by Tet proteins and converted to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, two bases that can be removed from DNA by base excision repair. The completed pathway represents a replication-independent DNA demethylation cycle. However, the DNA base 5hmC is also known to be rather stable and occurs at substantial levels, for example in the brain, suggesting that it represents an epigenetic mark by itself that may regulate chromatin structure and transcription. Focusing on a few well-studied tissues and developmental stages, we discuss the opposing views of 5hmC as a transient intermediate in DNA demethylation and as a modified DNA base with an instructive role.},

With multiple treatment options available for patients with mCSPC, treatment selection to optimize patient outcomes has become increasingly difficult. Here, we review the clinical trials involving ADT plus docetaxel or abiraterone and provide clinicians with guidelines for treatment. Although surgery and/or radiation are standard of care for localized, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, these treatments are not routinely used as part of initial treatment plans for patients with de novo mCSPC. Recent clinical data are challenging that dogma, and we review the literature on the addition of surgery and radiation to systemic therapy for mCSPC. Finally, the standard of care for oligometastatic prostate cancer (a subset of mCSPC with limited metastases) has not been established compared with that for some other cancers. We discuss the recent studies on metastasis-directed therapy for treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation aberrations are common in many cancer types. A major challenge hindering comparison of patient-derived samples is that they comprise of heterogeneous collection of cancer and microenvironment cells. We present a computational method that allows comparing cancer methylomes in two or more heterogeneous tumor samples featuring differing, unknown fraction of cancer cells. The method is unique in that it allows comparison also in the absence of normal cell control samples and without prior tumor purity estimates, as these are often unavailable or unreliable in clinical samples. We use simulations and next-generation methylome, RNA, and whole-genome sequencing data from two cancer types to demonstrate that the method is accurate and outperforms alternatives. The results show that our method adapts well to various cancer types and to a wide range of tumor content, and works robustly without a control or with controls derived from various sources. The method is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/anthakki/dmml.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list\textemdash reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the ``tumor microenvironment.'' Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Emerging evidence indicates that these higher-order chromatin structures play important roles in regulating genome functions such as transcription and DNA replication. With the advancement in 3C (chromosome conformation capture) based technologies, Hi-C has been widely used to investigate genome-wide longrange chromatin interactions during cellular differentiation and oncogenesis. Since the first publication of Hi-C assay in 2009, lots of bioinformatic tools have been implemented for processing Hi-C data from mapping raw reads to normalizing contact matrix and high interpretation, either providing a whole workflow pipeline or focusing on a particular process. Results: This article reviews the general Hi-C data processing workflow and the currently popular Hi-C data processing tools. We highlight on how these tools are used for a full interpretation of Hi-C results. Conclusions: Hi-C assay is a powerful tool to investigate the higher-order chromatin structure. Continued development of novel methods for Hi-C data analysis will be necessary for better understanding the regulatory function of genome organization.},

Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We found an average of 35.8\% heterogeneous somatic mutations with strong evidence of ITH. Half of the driver mutations located on the branches of tumor phylogenetic trees targeted oncogenes, including PIK3CA, NFE2L2 and MTOR, among others. By contrast, the majority of truncal and clonal driver mutations occurred in tumor-suppressor genes, including TP53, KMT2D and ZNF750, among others. Interestingly, phyloepigenetic trees robustly recapitulated the topological structures of the phylogenetic trees, indicating a possible relationship between genetic and epigenetic alterations. Our integrated investigations of spatial ITH and clonal evolution provide an important molecular foundation for enhanced understanding of tumorigenesis and progression in ESCC.},

One key way of analysing such data is to look for elements of the data which display particular patterns of differential expression in order to take these forward for further analysis and validation. We propose a framework for defining patterns of differential expression and develop a novel algorithm, baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples. The method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data and derives an empirically determined prior distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the performance of the method on real and simulated data. Our method performs at least as well, and often better, than existing methods for analyses of pairwise differential expression in both real and simulated data. When we compare methods for the analysis of data from experimental designs involving multiple sample groups, our method again shows substantial gains in performance. We believe that this approach thus represents an important step forward for the analysis of count data from sequencing experiments.},

CNEs exhibit extreme levels of sequence conservation of unexplained origin, with many acting as long-range enhancers during development. Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, precisely predicting the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation, which we term devTADs, exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation. The correspondence between GRBs and TADs suggests that TADs around developmental genes are ancient, slowly evolving genomic structures, many of which have had conserved spans for hundreds of millions of years. This relationship also explains the difference in TAD numbers and sizes between genomes. While the close correlation between extreme conservation and the boundaries of this subset of TADs does not reveal the mechanism leading to the conservation of these elements, it provides a functional framework for studying the role of TADs in long-range transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation promotes transcription DNA methylation generally represses transcription, but in some instances, it has also been implicated in transcription activation. Harris et al. identified a protein complex in Arabidopsis that is recruited to chromatin by DNA methylation. This complex specifically activated the transcription of genes that are already mildly transcribed but had no effect on transcriptionally silent genes such as transposable elements. The complex thereby counteracts the repression effect caused by transposon insertion in neighboring genes while leaving transposons silent. Thus, by balancing both repressive and activating transcriptional effects, DNA methylation can act to fine-tune gene expression. Science, this issue p. 1182 DNA methylation generally functions as a repressive transcriptional signal, but it is also known to activate gene expression. In either case, the downstream factors remain largely unknown. By using comparative interactomics, we isolated proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana that associate with methylated DNA. Two SU(VAR)3-9 homologs, the transcriptional antisilencing factor SUVH1, and SUVH3, were among the methyl reader candidates. SUVH1 and SUVH3 bound methylated DNA in vitro, were associated with euchromatic methylation in vivo, and formed a complex with two DNAJ domain-containing homologs, DNAJ1 and DNAJ2. Ectopic recruitment of DNAJ1 enhanced gene transcription in plants, yeast, and mammals. Thus, the SUVH proteins bind to methylated DNA and recruit the DNAJ proteins to enhance proximal gene expression, thereby counteracting the repressive effects of transposon insertion near genes. A protein complex that binds methylated DNA can counteract the repressive effects of transposon invasion on neighboring gene expression. A protein complex that binds methylated DNA can counteract the repressive effects of transposon invasion on neighboring gene expression.},

Inference of tumor subpopulations has been disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic point mutations, whereas computational methods targeting evolutionary dynamics of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in whole-genome sequencing data remain underdeveloped. We present a novel probabilistic model, TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from whole-genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of breast tumors that the inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically informs population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.},

For example, in plants, various factors, such as local soil quality, microclimate, and sowing depth, affect growth differences among individual plants of isogenic populations. Besides these physical factors, also epigenetic components contribute to differences in growth and yield. The network that regulates crop yield is still not well understood. Although this network is expected to have epigenetic elements, it is completely unclear whether it would be possible to shape the epigenome to increase crop yield. Here we show that energy use efficiency is an important factor in determining seed yield in canola (Brassica napus) and that it can be selected artificially through an epigenetic feature. From an isogenic canola population of which the individual plants and their self-fertilized progenies were recursively selected for respiration intensity, populations with distinct physiological and agronomical characteristics could be generated. These populations were found to be genetically identical, but epigenetically different. Furthermore, both the DNA methylation patterns as well as the agronomical and physiological characteristics of the selected lines were heritable. Hybrids derived from parent lines selected for high energy use efficiencies had a 5\% yield increase on top of heterosis. Our results demonstrate that artificial selection allows the increase of the yield potential by selecting populations with particular epigenomic states.},

Background fitness is specific to an individual but not linked to its strategy. It can be thought of as a property that is related to the physical or societal position of an individual, but is not dependent on the strategy that is adopted in the evolutionary process under consideration. In our model, an individual's total fitness is the sum of its background fitness and the fitness derived from using a specific strategy. This approach has important implications for the imitation of behavioural strategies: if we imitate others for their success, but can only adopt their behaviour and not their social and economic ties, we may imitate in vain. We study the effect of heterogeneity in background fitness on the fixation of a mutant strategy with constant fitness. We find that heterogeneity suppresses selection, but also decreases the time until a novel strategy either takes over the population or is lost again. We derive analytical solutions of the fixation probability in small populations. In the case of large total background fitness in a population with maximum inequality, we find a particularly simple approximation of the fixation probability. Numerical simulations suggest that this simple approximation also holds for larger population sizes.},

Genomic investigations indicate that relapsed disease often arises from a minor clone of cells present at diagnosis. However, both genetic and epigenetic variation have been observed in B-ALL and other leukemias, and why come cells with particular genetic or epigenetic profiles survive therapy remains unknown. Here, we use targeted genome sequencing, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and bisulfite sequencing of patient-matched samples with PDXs to investigate the dynamics of the genome and epigenome over B-ALL relapse. We find that \textbackslash glsentrylong\{dname\} profiles most closely resemble genetic clones at diagnosis and relapse. Moreover, we find widespread increases to \textbackslash glsentrylong\{dname\} at relapse, mirroring a more stem-like phenotype.

However, the impact of this instability on the non-coding genome and its three-dimensional organization to aid progression is unclear. Using primary benign and tumor tissue, we find a high concordance in higher order three-dimensional genome organization. This concordance argues for constraints to the topology of prostate tumor genomes. Nonetheless, we identified changes in focal chromatin interactions, typical of loops bridging non-coding cis-regulatory elements, and showed how structural variants can induce these changes to guide cis-regulatory element hijacking. Such events resulted in opposing differential expression of genes found at antipodes of rearrangements. Collectively, these results argue that changes to focal chromatin interactions, as opposed to higher order genome organization, allow for aberrant gene regulation and are repeatedly mediated by structural variants in primary prostate cancer.},

We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in~vivo. Together, these studies provide evidence for an adaptive response that enables epigenetic persistence to metabolic stress.},

Despite drastically increased evidence of multiple levels of heterogeneity in cancer, the general approach has been to eliminate the "noise" of heterogeneity to establish genetic and epigenetic patterns. In particular, the appreciation of new types of epigenetic regulation like non-coding RNA, have led to the hope of solving the mystery of cancer that the current genetic theories seem to be unable to achieve. In this mini-review, we have briefly analyzed a number of mis-conceptions regarding cancer heterogeneity, followed by the re-evaluation of cancer heterogeneity within a framework of the genome-centric concept of evolution. The analysis of the relationship between gene, epigenetic and genome level heterogeneity, and the challenges of measuring heterogeneity among multiple levels have been discussed. Further, we propose that measuring genome level heterogeneity represents an effective strategy in the study of cancer and other types of complex diseases, as emphasis on the pattern of system evolution rather than specific pathways provides a global and synthetic approach. Compared to the degree of heterogeneity, individual molecular pathways will have limited predictability during stochastic cancer evolution where genome dynamics (reflected by karyotypic heterogeneity) will dominate.},

  abstract = {The recently identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15INK4B is localized to a region on chromosome 9p21 frequently deleted in human tumors. Previous evidence has pointed to a related gene, p16INK4A, as the principal target of this deletion. We report that in gliomas and, to a striking degree, in leukemias, the p15 gene is commonly inactivated in association with promoter region hypermethylation involving multiple sites in a 5{${'}$}-CpG island. In some gliomas and all of the primary leukemias, this event occurs without alteration of the adjacent gene, p16INK4A. In other tumors, including lung, head and neck, breast, prostate, and colon cancer, inactivation of p16INK4B occurs only rarely and only with concomitant inactivation of p16. Aberrant methylation of p15INK4B is associated with transcriptional loss of this gene. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2{${'}$}-deoxycytidine leads to re-expression of p15 mRNA. In selected leukemia cell lines, p15 inactivation correlates with known resistance to the growth-suppressive effects of transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}. These results suggest that p15INK4B is inactivated selectively in leukemias and gliomas and seems to constitute an important tumor suppressor gene loss in these neoplasms.},

  abstract = {In the cell, Dnmt1 is the major enzyme in maintenance of the pattern of DNA methylation after DNA replication. Evidence suggests that the protein is located at the replication fork, where it could directly modify nascent DNA immediately after replication. To elucidate the potential mechanism of this process, we investigate the processivity of DNA methylation and accuracy of copying an existing pattern of methylation in this study using purified Dnmt1 and hemimethylated substrate DNA. We demonstrate that Dnmt1 methylates a hemimethylated 958-mer substrate in a highly processive reaction. Fully methylated and unmethylated CG sites do not inhibit processive methylation of the DNA. Extending previous work, we show that unmethylated sites embedded in a hemimethylated context are modified at an approximately 24-fold reduced rate, which demonstrates that the enzyme accurately copies existing patterns of methylation. Completely unmodified DNA is methylated even more slowly due to an allosteric activation of Dnmt1 by methylcytosine-containing DNA. Interestingly, Dnmt1 is not able to methylate hemimethylated CG sites on different strands of the DNA in a processive manner, indicating that Dnmt1 keeps its orientation with respect to the DNA while methylating the CG sites on one strand of the DNA.},

Although methods for scRNA-seq data integration exist6,7, they often naively merge data sets together even when the data sets have no cell types in common, leading to results that do not correspond to real biological patterns. Here we present Scanorama, inspired by algorithms for panorama stitching, that overcomes the limitations of existing methods to enable accurate, heterogeneous scRNA-seq data set integration. Our strategy identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of data sets and is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. We use Scanorama to combine 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments across 9 different technologies into a single comprehensive reference, demonstrating how Scanorama can be used to obtain a more complete picture of cellular function across a wide range of scRNA-seq experiments.},

TET2 mutant (TET2 MT) clones are also found in asymptomatic elderly individuals, a condition referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). In various entities of TET2 MT neoplasia, we examined the phenotype in relation to the strata of TET2 hits within the clonal hierarchy. Using deep sequencing, 1781 mutations were found in 1205 of 4930 patients; 40\% of mutant cases were biallelic. Hierarchical analysis revealed that of TET2 MT cases  {$>$} 40\% were ancestral, e.g., representing 8\% of MDS. Higher (earlier) TET2 lesion rank within the clonal hierarchy (greater clonal burden) was associated with impaired survival. Moreover, MDS driven by ancestral TET2 MT is likely derived from TET2 MT CHIP with a penetrance of \textasciitilde 1\%. Following ancestral TET2 mutations, individual disease course is determined by secondary hits. Using multidimensional analyses, we demonstrate how hits following the TET2 founder defect induces phenotypic shifts toward dysplasia, myeloproliferation, or progression to AML. In summary, TET2 MT CHIP-derived MDS is a subclass of MDS that is distinct from de novo disease.},

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows genome-wide discovery of protein-DNA interactions such as transcription factor bindings and histone modifications. Previous reports only compared a small number of profiles, and little has been done to compare histone modification profiles generated by the two technologies or to assess the impact of input DNA libraries in ChIP-seq analysis. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of a modENCODE dataset consisting of 31 pairs of ChIP-chip/ChIP-seq profiles of the coactivator CBP, RNA polymerase II (RNA PolII), and six histone modifications across four developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster. Both technologies produce highly reproducible profiles within each platform, ChIP-seq generally produces profiles with a better signal-to-noise ratio, and allows detection of more peaks and narrower peaks. The set of peaks identified by the two technologies can be significantly different, but the extent to which they differ varies depending on the factor and the analysis algorithm. Importantly, we found that there is a significant variation among multiple sequencing profiles of input DNA libraries and that this variation most likely arises from both differences in experimental condition and sequencing depth. We further show that using an inappropriate input DNA profile can impact the average signal profiles around genomic features and peak calling results, highlighting the importance of having high quality input DNA data for normalization in ChIP-seq analysis. Our findings highlight the biases present in each of the platforms, show the variability that can arise from both technology and analysis methods, and emphasize the importance of obtaining high quality and deeply sequenced input DNA libraries for ChIP-seq analysis.},

The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Hi-C is commonly used to study three-dimensional genome organization. However, due to the high sequencing cost and technical constraints, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets is coarse, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here we develop DeepHiC, a generative adversarial network, to predict high-resolution Hi-C contact maps from low-coverage sequencing data. We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1\% downsampled reads. Empowered by adversarial training, our method can restore fine-grained details similar to those in high-resolution Hi-C matrices, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy of prediction. Finally, application of DeepHiC to Hi-C data on mouse embryonic development can facilitate chromatin loop detection. We develop a web-based tool (DeepHiC, http://sysomics.com/deephic) that allows researchers to enhance their own Hi-C data with just a few clicks.},

  abstract = {Background: There has been a long-standing need in biomedical research for a method that quantifies the normally mixed composition of leukocytes beyond what is possible by simple histological or flow cytometric assessments. The latter is restricted by the labile nature of protein epitopes, requirements for cell processing, and timely cell analysis. In a diverse array of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures, leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls. Results: Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from purified leukocyte samples. We validate the fundamental idea in a cell mixture reconstruction experiment, then demonstrate our method on DNA methylation data sets from several studies, including data from a Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) study and an ovarian cancer study. Our method produces results consistent with prior biological findings, thereby validating the approach. Conclusions: Our method, in combination with an appropriate external validation set, promises new opportunities for large-scale immunological studies of both disease states and noxious exposures.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell mixture on the measurement of DNA methylation, specifically the extent to which small perturbations in cell mixture proportions can register as changes in DNA methylation. A recently published set of statistical methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell mixture proportions, and these methods are presently being applied to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome-wide association studies. However, these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets, which may be laborious or expensive to collect. For some tissues such as placenta, saliva, adipose or tumor tissue, the relevant underlying cell types may not be known.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: We propose a method for conducting epigenome-wide association studies analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable, including a bootstrap method for estimating standard errors.

  abstract = {Recent interest in reference-free deconvolution of DNA methylation data has led to several supervised methods, but these methods do not easily permit the interpretation of underlying cell types. We propose a simple method for reference-free deconvolution that provides both proportions of putative cell types defined by their underlying methylomes, the number of these constituent cell types, as well as a method for evaluating the extent to which the underlying methylomes reflect specific types of cells. We demonstrate these methods in an analysis of 23 Infinium data sets from 13 distinct data collection efforts; these empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can reasonably estimate the number of constituent types, return cell proportion estimates that demonstrate anticipated associations with underlying phenotypic data; and methylomes that reflect the underlying biology of constituent cell types. Our methodology permits an explicit quantitation of the mediation of phenotypic associations with DNA methylation by cell composition effects. Although more work is needed to investigate functional information related to estimated methylomes, our proposed method provides a novel and useful foundation for conducting DNA methylation studies on heterogeneous tissues lacking reference data.},

However, to accurately analyze the mechanism by which transcriptome, genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic methods need to be performed in the same single cell. Here we demonstrate a single-cell triple omics sequencing technique, scTrio-seq, that can be used to simultaneously analyze the genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of an individual mammalian cell. We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.},

Although somatic VHL mutations have been described for some time, more-recent cancer genomic studies have identified mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes and demonstrated marked intra-tumour heterogeneity, which could have prognostic, predictive and therapeutic relevance. Localized RCC can be successfully managed with surgery, whereas metastatic RCC is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. However, over the past decade, marked advances in the treatment of metastatic RCC have been made, with targeted agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, pazopanib and axitinib, which inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR), and everolimus and temsirolimus, which inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), being approved. Since 2015, agents with additional targets aside from VEGFR have been approved, such as cabozantinib and lenvatinib; immunotherapies, such as nivolumab, have also been added to the armamentarium for metastatic RCC. Here, we provide an overview of the biology of RCC, with a focus on ccRCC, as well as updates to complement the current clinical guidelines and an outline of potential future directions for RCC research and therapy.},

Here, we overcome some limitations of conventional 3C-based methods by using high-resolution Micro-C to probe links between 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome organization, establishing functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Genetic instability is invoked in explaining the cell phenotype changes that take place during cancer progression. However, the coexistence of a vast diversity of distinct clones, most prominently visible in the form of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, suggests that Darwinian selection of mutant cells is not operating at maximal efficacy. Conversely, non-genetic instability of cancer cells must also be considered. Such mutation-independent instability of cell states is most prosaically manifest in the phenotypic heterogeneity within clonal cell populations or in the reversible switching between immature "cancer stem cell-like" and more differentiated states. How are genetic and non-genetic instability related to each other? Here, we review basic theoretical foundations and offer a dynamical systems perspective in which cancer is the inevitable pathological manifestation of modes of malfunction that are immanent to the complex gene regulatory network of the genome. We explain in an accessible, qualitative, and permissively simplified manner the mathematical basis for the "epigenetic landscape" and how the latter relates to the better known "fitness landscape." We show that these two classical metaphors have a formal basis. By combining these two landscape concepts, we unite development and somatic evolution as the drivers of the relentless increase in malignancy. Herein, the cancer cells are pushed toward cancer attractors in the evolutionarily unused regions of the epigenetic landscape that encode more and more "dedifferentiated" states as a consequence of both genetic (mutagenic) and non-genetic (regulatory) perturbations-including therapy. This would explain why for the cancer cell, the principle of "What does not kill me makes me stronger" is as much a driving force in tumor progression and development of drug resistance as the simple principle of "survival of the fittest."},

Nevertheless, experimental advances suggest that this irregular packing is associated with many nontrivial physical properties that are puzzling from a polymer physics point of view. Here, we show that the reconciliation of these exotic properties necessitates modularizing three-dimensional genome into tree data structures on top of, and in striking contrast to, the linear topology of DNA double helix. These functional modules need to be connected and isolated by an open backbone that results in porous and heterogeneous packing in a quasi\textendash self-similar manner, as revealed by our electron and optical imaging. Our multiscale theoretical and experimental results suggest the existence of higher-order universal folding principles for a disordered chromatin fiber to avoid entanglement and fulfill its biological functions.},

  abstract = {The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology has made it possible to measure gene expression variations at cellular level. This breakthrough enables the investigation of a wider range of problems including analysis of splicing heterogeneity among individual cells. However, compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data are much noisier due to high technical variability and low sequencing depth. Here we propose SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential splicing analysis in scRNA-seq, which achieves high sensitivity at low coverage by accounting for technical noise. SCATS models scRNA-seq data either with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For non-UMI data, SCATS explicitly models technical noise by accounting for capture efficiency and amplification bias through the use of external spike-ins; for UMI data, SCATS models capture efficiency and further accounts for transcriptional burstiness. A key aspect of SCATS lies in its ability to group ``exons'' that originate from the same isoform(s). Grouping exons is essential in splicing analysis of scRNA-seq data as it naturally aggregates spliced reads across different exons, making it possible to detect splicing events even when sequencing depth is low. To evaluate the performance of SCATS, we analyzed both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets and compared with existing methods including Census and DEXSeq. We show that SCATS has well controlled type I error rate, and is more powerful than existing methods, especially when splicing difference is small. In contrast, Census suffers from severe type I error inflation, whereas DEXSeq is more conservative. When applied to mouse brain scRNA-seq datasets, SCATS identified more differential splicing events with subtle difference across cell types compared to Census and DEXSeq. With the increasing adoption of scRNA-seq, we believe SCATS will be well-suited for various splicing studies. The implementation of SCATS can be downloaded from https://github.com/huyustats/SCATS.},

To address the challenge of stochastic data loss associated with single cell measurements, current strategies average methylation in windows or region sets. However previous studies have demonstrated that single CpGs are functional and our analysis of single cell methylation measurements revealed a rapid decay in concordance neighbouring CpG states beyond 1kb. To leverage the information content of individual CpGs in the context of single cell methylation measurements we developed an analytical strategy for deriving single-cell DNA methylation states using individual CpGs, which we term PDclust. We validated PDclust on existing datasets and on data we generated from single index-sorted murine and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are highly enriched in functionally defined stem cells. Using PDClust, we identified epigenetically distinct subpopulations within these HSC populations. Strikingly, human cord blood derived HSC populations were separable by donor specific methylation states whereas more differentiated hematopoietic cells separated solely by cell type. Interestingly, removal of methylation sites near genetic variants did not impact this separation, suggesting that these epigenetic states may be a consequence of environmental differences. Finally, through protocol optimization and deep sequencing we generated one of the most comprehensive sets of single cell methylome profiles (20\% of CpGs on average) and from these were able to generate genomewide profiles from as little as 6 epigenetically related HSCs to derive subtype-specific regulatory states.},

A major challenge has been to understand the direct correlation of DNA methylation and gene expression within single-cells. Due to large cell-to-cell variability and the lack of direct measurements of transcriptome and methylome of the same cell, the association is still unclear. Here, we describe a novel method (scMT-seq) that simultaneously profiles both DNA methylome and transcriptome from the same cell. In sensory neurons, we consistently identify transcriptome and methylome heterogeneity among single cells but the majority of the expression variance is not explained by proximal promoter methylation, with the exception of genes that do not contain CpG islands. By contrast, gene body methylation is positively associated with gene expression for only those genes that contain a CpG island promoter. Furthermore, using single nucleotide polymorphism patterns from our hybrid mouse model, we also find positive correlation of allelic gene body methylation with allelic expression. Our method can be used to detect transcriptome, methylome, and single nucleotide polymorphism information within single cells to dissect the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.},

In the past decade, next generation sequencing has enabled critical advances in our understanding of leukemogenesis. These include the identification of risk-associated ALL subtypes (e.g., those with rearrangements of MEF2D, DUX4, NUTM1, ZNF384 and BCL11B; the PAX5 P80R and IKZF1 N159Y mutations; and genomic phenocopies such as Ph-like ALL) and the genomic basis of disease evolution. These advances have been complemented by the development of novel therapeutic approaches, including those that are of mutation-specific, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and those that are mutation-agnostic, including antibody and cellular immunotherapies, and protein degradation strategies such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Herein, we review the genetic taxonomy of ALL with a focus on clinical implications and the implementation of genomic diagnostic approaches.},

  abstract = {The development of effective treatment strategies for most forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has languished for the past several decades. There are a number of reasons for this, but key among them is the considerable heterogeneity of this disease and the paucity of molecular markers that can be used to predict clinical outcomes and responsiveness to different therapies. The recent large-scale sequencing of AML genomes is now providing opportunities for patient stratification and personalized approaches to treatment that are based on individual mutational profiles. It is particularly notable that studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas and others have determined that 44\% of patients with AML exhibit mutations in genes that regulate methylation of genomic DNA. In particular, frequent mutation has been observed in the genes encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), as well as Tet oncogene family member 2. This review will summarize the incidence of these mutations, their impact on biochemical functions including epigenetic modification of genomic DNA and their potential usefulness as prognostic indicators. Importantly, the presence of DNMT3A, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations may confer sensitivity to novel therapeutic approaches, including the use of demethylating agents. Therefore, the clinical experience with decitabine and azacitidine in the treatment of patients harboring these mutations will be reviewed. Overall, we propose that understanding the role of these mutations in AML biology will lead to more rational therapeutic approaches targeting molecularly defined subtypes of the disease.},

The resulting Markov process has two absorbing states corresponding to homogeneous populations of all A or all B. We quantify frequency dependent selection by comparing the absorption probabilities to the corresponding probabilities under random drift. We derive conditions for selection to favor one strategy or the other by using the concept of total positivity. In the limit of weak selection, we obtain the 1/3 law: if A and B are strict Nash equilibria then selection favors replacement of B by A, if the unstable equilibrium occurs at a frequency of A which is less than 1/3.},

While disruption of chromatin domains and domain boundaries can lead to misexpression of developmental genes, acute depletion of regulators of genome organization has a relatively small effect on gene expression. It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the               Drosophila melanogaster               embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active.},

We have discovered that mice expressing endogenous mutant IDH1 have reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in contrast to Tet2 knockout (TET2-KO) mice. Mutant IDH1 downregulates the DNA damage (DD) sensor ATM by altering histone methylation, leading to impaired DNA repair, increased sensitivity to DD, and reduced HSC self-renewal, independent of TET2. ATM expression is also decreased in human IDH1-mutated AML. These findings may have implications for treatment of IDH-mutant leukemia.},

Elevated D-2HG can block differentiation of malignant cells by functioning as a competitive inhibitor of {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate ({$\alpha$}-KG)-dependent enzymes, including Jumonji family histone lysine demethylases. 2HG is a chiral molecule that can exist in either the D-enantiomer or the L-enantiomer. Although cancer-associated IDH1/2 mutants produce D-2HG, biochemical studies have demonstrated that L-2HG also functions as a potent inhibitor of {$\alpha$}-KG-dependent enzymes. Here we report that under conditions of oxygen limitation, mammalian cells selectively produce L-2HG via enzymatic reduction of {$\alpha$}-KG. Hypoxia-induced L-2HG is not mediated by IDH1 or IDH2, but instead results from promiscuous substrate usage primarily by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). During hypoxia, the resulting increase in L-2HG is necessary and sufficient for the induction of increased methylation of histone repressive marks, including histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3).},

  abstract = {The threonine-to-methionine substitution at amino acid position 790 (T790M) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene has been reported in progressing lesions after gefitinib treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that causes sensitive tumors to become resistant to gefitinib. Alternatively, the EGFR T790M mutation might be present in small fractions of tumor cells before drug treatment, and the tumor cells harboring the T790M mutation might be enriched during the proliferation after drug treatment. We developed a mutant-enriched PCR assay to detect small fractions of cells with T790M mutation and used this technique to detect mutations in 280 NSCLCs, including gefitinib-treated 95 cases. Although the direct sequencing detected only 1 T790M mutant case, the mutant-enriched PCR (confirmed to enrich one mutant out of 1 x 10(3) wild-type alleles) detected 9 additional cases among 280 cases. As linkage to clinicopathologic factors, the T790M mutation showed no bias for sex, smoking status, or histology but was significantly more frequent in advanced tumors (9 of 111 cases) than in early-stage tumors (1 of 169 cases; P = 0.0013). Among gefitinib-treated cases, gefitinib-sensitive mutations were found in 30 cases. The T790M mutation was present in 3 of 7 no-responders with the gefitinib-sensitive mutation and was not present in 19 responders (P = 0.014). Our results indicate that the T790M mutation is sometimes present in a minor population of tumor cells during the development of NSCLC and suggest that the detection of small fractions of T790M mutant alleles may be useful for predicting gefitinib resistance of NSCLCs with sensitive EGFR mutations.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Numerous genes are aberrantly expressed in tumors, but its cause remains unclear. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are repetitive elements in the genome and have a potential to work as enhancers modulating adjacent genes. Since numerous HERVs are activated epigenetically in tumors, their activation could alter gene expression globally in tumors and change the tumor characteristics. Here, we show the HERV activation in tumors is associated with the upregulation of hundreds of transcriptional suppressors, Kruppel-associated box domain-containing zinc-finger family proteins (KZFPs). KZFP genes are preferentially encoded nearby the activated HERVs in tumors and transcriptionally regulated by the adjacent HERVs. Increased HERV and KZFP expression in tumors was associated with better disease conditions. Many KZFPs could suppress the progressive characteristics of cancer cells by downregulating genes related to the cell cycle and cell-matrix adhesion. Our data suggest that HERV activation in tumors drives the concerted expression of KZFP genes for tumor suppression.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Acquired drug resistance is a major limitation for cancer therapy. Often, one genetic alteration suffices to confer resistance to an otherwise successful therapy. However, little is known about the dynamics of the emergence of resistant tumor cells. In this article, we consider an exponentially growing population starting from one cancer cell that is sensitive to therapy. Sensitive cancer cells can mutate into resistant ones, which have relative fitness a prior to therapy. In the special case of no cell death, our model converges to the one investigated by Luria and Delbru\textasciidieresis{} ck. We calculate the probability of resistance and the mean number of resistant cells once the cancer has reached detection size M. The probability of resistance is an increasing function of the detection size M times the mutation rate u. If Mu {$>$} 1, then the expected number of resistant cells in cancers with resistance is independent of the mutation rate u and increases with M in proportion to M 1\"y1=a for advantageous mutants with relative fitness a . 1, to ln M for neutral mutants (a {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1), but converges to an upper limit for deleterious mutants (a , 1). Further, the probability of resistance and the average number of resistant cells increase with the number of cell divisions in the history of the tumor. Hence a tumor subject to high rates of apoptosis will show a higher incidence of resistance than expected on its detection size only.},

In this paper, we calculate the probability as a function of time that a population of cells has generated at least one cell with two inactivated alleles of a TSG. Different kinetic laws hold for small and large populations. The inactivation of the first allele can either be neutral or lead to a selective advantage or disadvantage. The inactivation of the first and of the second allele can occur at equal or different rates. Our calculations provide insights into basic aspects of population genetics determining cancer initiation and progression.},

We start with a homogeneous population of type 0. Mutants of type 1 emerge and either become extinct or reach fixation. In both cases, they can generate type 2, which also can become extinct or reach fixation. If mutation rates are small compared to the inverse of the population size, then the stochastic dynamics can be described by transitions between homogeneous populations. A ``stochastic tunnel'' arises, when the population moves from all 0 to all 2 without ever being all 1. We calculate the exact rate of stochastic tunneling for the case when type 1 is as fit as type 0 or less fit. Type 2 has the highest fitness. We discuss implications for the elimination of tumor suppressor genes and the activation of genetic instability. Although our theory is developed for cancer genetics, stochastic tunnels are general phenomena that could arise in many circumstances.},

Transcriptionally, FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG are shown to be essential for luminal subtype-specific gene regulation and subtype switching, while TP63, STAT3, and TFAP2 family members are critical for regulation of basal subtype-specific genes. Despite these advances, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms and 3D chromatin architecture responsible for subtype-specific regulation in bladder cancer remain unknown.                                         Result               We determine the genome-wide transcriptome, enhancer landscape, and transcription factor binding profiles of FOXA1 and GATA3 in luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer. Furthermore, we report the first-ever mapping of genome-wide chromatin interactions by Hi-C in both bladder cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors. We show that subtype-specific transcription is accompanied by specific open chromatin and epigenomic marks, at least partially driven by distinct transcription factor binding at distal enhancers of luminal and basal bladder cancers. Finally, we identify a novel clinically relevant transcription factor, Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (NPAS2), in luminal bladder cancers that regulates other subtype-specific genes and influences cancer cell proliferation and migration.

This heterogeneity has been the source of significant clinical challenges facing patients with GBM and has hampered the drive toward more precision or personalized medicine approaches to treating these challenging tumors. Over the last two decades, the field of Mathematical Neuro-oncology has grown out of desire to use (often patient-specific) mathematical modeling to better treat GBMs. Here, we will focus on a series of clinically relevant results using patient-specific mathematical modeling. The core model at the center of these results incorporates two hallmark features of GBM, proliferation and invasion (D), as key parameters. Based on routinely obtained magnetic resonance images, each patient's tumor can be characterized using these two parameters. The Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model uses and D to create patient-specific growth predictions. The PI model, its predictions, and parameters have been used in a number of ways to derive biological insight. Beyond predicting growth, the PI model has been utilized to identify patients who benefit from different surgery strategies, to prognosticate response to radiation therapy, to develop a treatment response metric, and to connect clinical imaging features and genetic information. Demonstration of the PI model's clinical relevance supports the growing role for it and other mathematical models in routine clinical practice.},

We also demonstrate that, in these studies, cellular composition explains much of the observed variability in DNA methylation. Furthermore, we find high levels of confounding between age-related variability and cellular composition at the CpG level.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of considering cell composition variability in epigenetic studies based on whole blood and other heterogeneous tissue sources. We also provide software for estimating and exploring this composition confounding for the Illumina 450k microarray.},

We apply these procedures to genome-wide methylation data obtained from biological and technical replicates and provide the first statistical proof that variably methylated regions exist and are due to interindividual variation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The incidence of hematologic cancers increases with age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS Detectable somatic mutations were rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to 89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal mutations were observed in 9.5\% (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7\% (37 of 317), and 18.4\% (19 of 103), respectively. The majority of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and increases in the risks of incident coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.4) and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS Age-related clonal hematopoiesis is a common condition that is associated with increases in the risk of hematologic cancer and in all-cause mortality, with the latter possibly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The least squares estimators were studied by Gauss and by other authors later in the nineteenth century. A proof that the best unbiased estimator of a linear function of the means of a set of observed random variables is the least squares estimator was given by Markov [12], a modified version of whose proof is given by David and Neyman [4]. A slightly more general theorem is given by Aitken [1]. Fisher [5] indicated that for large samples the maximum likelihood estimator approximately minimizes the mean squared error when compared with other reasonable estimators. This paper will be concerned with optimum properties or failure of optimum properties of the natural estimator in certain special problems with the risk usually measured by the mean squared error or, in the case of several parameters, by a quadratic function of the estimators. We shall first mention some recent papers on this subject and then give some results, mostly unpublished, in greater detail.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is a stable form of epigenetic memory used by cells to control gene expression. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has emerged as a gold-standard experimental technique for studying DNA methylation by producing high resolution genome-wide methylation profiles. Statistical modeling and analysis is employed to computationally extract and quantify information from these profiles in an effort to identify regions of the genome that demonstrate crucial or aberrant epigenetic behavior. However, the performance of most currently available methods for methylation analysis is hampered by their inability to directly account for statistical dependencies between neighboring methylation sites, thus ignoring significant information available in WGBS reads. We present a powerful information-theoretic approach for genome-wide modeling and analysis of WGBS data based on the 1D Ising model of statistical physics. This approach takes into account correlations in methylation by utilizing a joint probability model that encapsulates all information available in WGBS methylation reads and produces accurate results even when applied on single WGBS samples with low coverage. Using the Shannon entropy, our approach provides a rigorous quantification of methylation stochasticity in individual WGBS samples genome-wide. Furthermore, it utilizes the Jensen-Shannon distance to evaluate differences in methylation distributions between a test and a reference sample. Differential performance assessment using simulated and real human lung normal/cancer data demonstrate a clear superiority of our approach over DSS, a recently proposed method for WGBS data analysis. Critically, these results demonstrate that marginal methods become statistically invalid when correlations are present in the data. This contribution demonstrates clear benefits and the necessity of modeling joint probability distributions of methylation using the 1D Ising model of statistical physics and of quantifying methylation stochasticity using concepts from information theory. By employing this methodology, substantial improvement of DNA methylation analysis can be achieved by effectively taking into account the massive amount of statistical information available in WGBS data, which is largely ignored by existing methods.},

  abstract = {In his seminal work, Conrad Waddington employed deterministic dif-ferential equations to define epigenetics as the emergence of a pheno-type that can be perturbed by the environment but whose endpoints are predetermined by genes 1 . However, we have proposed a role for epigenetic stochasticity in development and disease 2,3 , which has led to relatively simple probabilistic models of epigenetic landscapes that account for randomness in DNA methylation by adding a 'noise' term to deterministic models 4,5 . Some authors have also characterized methylation stochasticity using the notion of epipolymorphism 6,7 , a form of nonadditive Tsallis entropy whose measurement is limited to a small portion of the genome and can underestimate heterogeneity in WGBS data 6,7 (Supplementary Note). Here we take a foundational approach to understanding epigenetic information using principles from statistical physics and information theory that organically incorporate stochasticity into the mathemati-cal framework and apply this approach on diverse WGBS data sets. In contrast to metaphorical 'Waddingtonian' landscapes, we present a rigorous derivation of epigenetic potential energy landscapes that encapsulate the higher-order statistical properties of methylation, fully capturing behavior that is opaque to customary mean-based summaries. We quantify methylation stochasticity using Shannon's entropy and provide a powerful information-theoretic methodology for distin-guishing epigenomes using the Jensen\textendash Shannon distance between sample-specific energy landscapes associated with stem cells, tissue lineages, and cancer. Moreover, we establish a relationship between entropy and topologically associating domains (TADs) that allows prediction of their boundaries from WGBS samples. We also introduce methylation channels as models of DNA methylation maintenance and show that their informational properties can effectively predict higher-order chromatin organization using machine learning. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity index that quantifies the rate by which environmental perturbations influence methylation stochasticity along the genome. This merger of epigenetic biology and statistical physics yields many fundamental insights into the relationship between informa-tion-theoretic properties of the epigenome and nuclear organization in normal development and disease. Moreover, it provides novel methods for evaluating the informational properties of individual samples and their chromatin structure and for quantifying differ-ences between tissue lineages, aging, and cancer at high resolution and genome-wide. RESULTS Stochastic epigenetic variation and energy landscapes Current methods for methylation analysis are limited predominantly to modeling stochastic variation at individual CpG sites while ignor-ing statistical dependence among neighboring sites 8 . However, fully characterizing the stochastic and polymorphic nature of epigenetic information requires knowledge of the probability distribution of methylation patterns (epialleles) formed by groups of CpG sites 6,7 . At present, this distribution is estimated empirically, requiring much higher coverage than WGBS data routinely provide (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note).

RUNX1 depletion consistently resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.

While environmental factors are well known to influence the accumulation of novel variation in microorganisms and human cancer cells, the extent to which the natural environment influences the accumulation of novel variation in plants is relatively unknown. Here we use whole-genome and whole-methylome sequencing to test if a specific environmental stress (high-salinity soil) changes the frequency and molecular profile of accumulated mutations and epimutations (changes in cytosine methylation status) in mutation accumulation (MA) lineages of Arabidopsis thaliana. We first show that stressed lineages accumulate {$\sim$}100\% more mutations, and that these mutations exhibit a distinctive molecular mutational spectrum (specific increases in relative frequency of transversion and insertion/deletion [indel] mutations). We next show that stressed lineages accumulate {$\sim$}45\% more differentially methylated cytosine positions (DMPs) at CG sites (CG-DMPs) than controls, and also show that while many ({$\sim$}75\%) of these CG-DMPs are inherited, some can be lost in subsequent generations. Finally, we show that stress-associated CG-DMPs arise more frequently in genic than in nongenic regions of the genome. We suggest that commonly encountered natural environmental stresses can accelerate the accumulation and change the profiles of novel inherited variants in plants. Our findings are significant because stress exposure is common among plants in the wild, and they suggest that environmental factors may significantly alter the rates and patterns of incidence of the inherited novel variants that fuel plant evolution.},

We demonstrate that in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, MLL3/4-dependent deposition of H3K4me1 at enhancers correlates with increased levels of chromatin interactions, whereas loss of MLL3/4 leads to greatly reduced frequencies of chromatin interactions and failure of lineage-specific gene expression programs. We further show that H3K4me1 facilitates recruitment of the Cohesin complex to chromatin in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for MLL3/4 to promote chromatin looping. Taken together, our results support an active role for MLL3/4 in modulating chromatin organization at enhancers in mammalian cells.},

In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a ``partial order plot''. Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available. PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any ``binary'' somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and deletions. The PhyloSub and partial order plot software is available from https://github.com/morrislab/phylosub/ .},

  abstract = {Epigenetic modifications must underlie lineage-specific differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express tissue-specific genes, but their DNA sequence is unchanged. Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs1, a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state. Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions.},

Methods for constructing sodium bisulfite-converted and amplified libraries have recently advanced to the point that the bottleneck for experiments that use WGBS has shifted to data analysis and interpretation. Here we present empirical evidence for an over-representation of reads from methylated DNA in WGBS. This enrichment for methylated DNA is exacerbated by higher cycles of PCR and is influenced by the type of uracil-insensitive DNA polymerase used for amplifying the sequencing library. Future efforts to computationally correct for this enrichment bias will be essential to increasing the accuracy of determining methylation levels for individual cytosines. It is especially critical for studies that seek to accurately quantify DNA methylation levels in populations that may segregate for allelic DNA methylation states.},

Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data. Results: Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using " single-cell energy " and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these ena-bles robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are \textendash{} in combination \textendash{} more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few pa-rameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communi-cation network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors im-portant for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dy-namics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition proba-bilities that control cell fates.

Such epigenetic alterations are thus a possible source of heritable phenotypic variation in the absence of DNA sequence change. However, attempts to assess the prevalence of stable epigenetic variation in natural and experimental populations and to quantify its impact on complex traits have been hampered by the confounding effects of DNA sequence polymorphisms. To overcome this problem as much as possible, two parents with little DNA sequence differences, but contrasting DNA methylation profiles, were used to derive a panel of epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The epiRILs showed variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height ({$\sim$}30\%), as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental DNA methylation variants (epialleles) over at least eight generations. These findings provide a first rationale to identify epiallelic variants that contribute to heritable variation in complex traits using linkage or association studies. More generally, the demonstration that numerous epialleles across the genome can be stable over many generations in the absence of selection or extensive DNA sequence variation highlights the need to integrate epigenetic information into population genetics studies.},

  abstract = {Interindividual differences in chromatin states at a locus (epialleles) can result in gene expression changes that are sometimes transmitted across generations. In this way, they can contribute to heritable phenotypic variation in natural and experimental populations independent of DNA sequence. Recent molecular evidence shows that epialleles often display high levels of transgenerational instability. This property gives rise to a dynamic dimension in phenotypic inheritance. To be able to incorporate these non-Mendelian features into quantitative genetic models, it is necessary to study the induction and the transgenerational behavior of epialleles in controlled settings. Here we outline a general experimental approach for achieving this using crosses of epigenomically perturbed isogenic lines in mammalian and plant species. We develop a theoretical description of such crosses and model the relationship between epiallelic instability, recombination, parent-of-origin effects, as well as transgressive segregation and their joint impact on phenotypic variation across generations. In the limiting case of fully stable epialleles our approach reduces to the classical theory of experimental line crosses and thus illustrates a fundamental continuity between genetic and epigenetic inheritance. We consider data from a panel of Arabidopsis epigenetic recombinant inbred lines and explore estimates of the number of quantitative trait loci for plant height that resulted from a manipulation of DNA methylation levels in one of the two isogenic founder strains.},

Conclusion and discussion Acknowledgements References Summary Heritable gains or losses of cytosine methylation can arise stochastically in plant genomes independently of DNA sequence changes. These so-called `spontaneous epimutations' appear to be a byproduct of imperfect DNA methylation maintenance and epigenome reinforcement events that occur in specialized cell types. There is continued interest in the plant epigenetics community in trying to understand the broader implications of these stochastic events, as some have been shown to induce heritable gene expression changes, shape patterns of methylation diversity within and among plant populations, and appear to be responsive to multi-generational environmental stressors. In this paper we synthesized our current knowledge of the molecular basis and functional consequences of spontaneous epimutations in plants, discuss technical and conceptual challenges, and highlight emerging research directions.},

Most of these approaches are not based on measuring individual cell methylation but rather the bulk tumor sample DNA, which contains a mixture of tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells and other stromal components. This raises questions about the purity of a certain tumor sample, given the varying degrees of stromal infiltration in different entities. Previous methods to infer tumor purity require or are based on the use of matching control samples which are rarely available. Here we present a novel, reference free method to quantify tumor purity, based on two Random Forest classifiers, which were trained on ABSOLUTE as well as ESTIMATE purity values from TCGA tumor samples. We subsequently apply this method to a previously published, large dataset of brain tumors, proving that these models perform well in datasets that have not been characterized with respect to tumor purity .},

Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both, whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV-16. Thus, HNSCC can be separated into HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. Despite evidence of histological progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive HNSCC, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSCC without a clinically evident antecedent pre-malignant lesion. Traditional staging of HNSCC using the tumour\textendash node\textendash metastasis system has been supplemented by the 2017 AJCC/UICC staging system, which incorporates additional information relevant to HPV-positive disease. Treatment is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral cavity cancers and primary CRT for pharynx and larynx cancers. The EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV-negative HNSCC where comorbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The FDA approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic landscape of HNSCC over the past decade has revealed new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Ongoing efforts aim to integrate our understanding of HNSCC biology and immunobiology to identify predictive biomarkers that will enable delivery of the most effective, least-toxic therapies.},

Here we integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colons with epigenetic, transcriptional, and imaging data to characterize alterations to chromatin loops, topologically associated domains, and large-scale compartments. We found that spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is profoundly compromised in tumors. This reorganization is accompanied by compartment-specific hypomethylation and chromatin changes. Additionally, we identify a compartment at the interface between the canonical A and B compartments that is reorganized in tumors. Remarkably, similar shifts were evident in non-malignant cells that have accumulated excess divisions. Our analyses suggest that these topological changes repress stemness and invasion programs while inducing anti-tumor immunity genes and may therefore restrain malignant progression. Our findings call into question the conventional view that tumor-associated epigenomic alterations are primarily oncogenic.},

Contact maps at sub-5-kb resolution allow identification of individual DNA loops, domain organization, and large-scale genome compartmentalization. We observed differences in looping architectures among GSCs from different patients, suggesting that 3D genome architecture is a further layer of inter-patient heterogeneity for glioblastoma. Integration of DNA contact maps with chromatin and transcriptional profiles identified specific mechanisms of gene regulation, including the convergence of multiple super enhancers to individual stemness genes within individual cells. We show that the number of loops contacting a gene correlates with elevated transcription. These results indicate that stemness genes are hubs of interaction between multiple regulatory regions, likely to ensure their sustained expression. Regions of open chromatin common among the GSCs tested were poised for expression of immune-related genes, including CD276. We demonstrate that this gene is co-expressed with stemness genes in GSCs and that CD276 can be targeted with an antibody-drug conjugate to eliminate self-renewing cells. Our results demonstrate that integrated structural genomics data sets can be employed to rationally identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in self-renewing cells.},

The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. Improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.},

Epigenetic silencing should be regarded as one of the pathways that is necessary to satisfy Knudson's hypothesis that two hits are required for a phenotypic consequence of tumour-suppressor gene loss. Recent advances in the field of chromatin structure are beginning to link the 'histone code' with the DNA 'cytosine-methylation code', which indicates that these two processes are intimately linked. Methylated cytosine contributes directly to the genetic inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by virtue of its enhanced mutability and by altering how cytosine residues interact with ultraviolet light and aromatic hydrocarbons. Cytosine methylation can also inactivate DNA-repair genes, therefore increasing the rate of mutagenesis. The mechanisms by which changes in DNA methylation are interpreted in normal and malignant cells are being deciphered rapidly. These alterations silence transcriptional initiation but do not block transcriptional elongation. The DNA-methyltransferase enzymes, which establish and maintain DNA-cytosine-methylation patterns, can also act as direct transcriptional repressors and interact with crucial chromatin-remodelling factors. These enzymes cooperate to maintain DNA-methylation patterns, and the roles of these multi-functional proteins are now beginning to be understood. DNA methylation and heterochromatin both have a propensity to spread from one region to another. This gradual spreading process can result in the permanent silencing of genes and presumably takes place when a breakdown occurs in the mechanisms that normally protect CpG islands from the DNA-methyltransferase enzymes. Genes that are silenced by inappropriate promoter hypermethylation can be relatively easily reactivated by treatment with DNA-methylation inhibitors, such as 5-aza nucleosides. New evidence shows that the activities of these inhibitors are enhanced by histone deacetylase inhibitors, which provides further evidence for a close interconnection between chromatin structure and DNA methylation. The altered methylation of CpG islands in DNA can be detected using highly sensitive techniques. This might allow for the development of new technologies to detect cancer cells and to provide prognostic information.},

Sperm distal ATAC-seq sites containing motifs for various transcription factors are conserved in monkeys and humans. ChIP-seq analyses confirm that Foxa1, ER{$\alpha$}, and AR occupy distal enhancers in sperm. Accessible sperm enhancers containing H3.3 and H2A.Z are also accessible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, their interactions with promoters in the gametes persist during early development. Sperm- or oocyte-specific interactions mediated by CTCF and cohesin are only present in the paternal or maternal chromosomes, respectively, in the zygote and 2-cell stages. These interactions converge in both chromosomes by the 8-cell stage. Thus, mammalian gametes contain complex patterns of 3D interactions that can be transmitted to the zygote after fertilization.},

Deficiency for the TET enzymes eliminates damage-induced 5hmC accumulation and elicits chromosome segregation defects in response to replication stress. Our results indicate that the TET enzymes and 5hmC play essential roles in ensuring genome integrity.},

Tumors have up to 30\% more alternative splicing events than normal samples. Association analysis of somatic variants with alternative splicing events confirmed known trans associations with variants in SF3B1 and U2AF1 and identified additional trans-acting variants (e.g., TADA1, PPP2R1A). Many tumors have thousands of alternative splicing events not detectable in normal samples; on average, we identified {$\approx$}930 exon-exon junctions (``neojunctions'') in tumors not typically found in GTEx normals. From Clinical~Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium data available for breast and ovarian tumor samples, we confirmed~{$\approx$}1.7 neojunction- and {$\approx$}0.6 single nucleotide variant-derived peptides per tumor sample that are also predicted major histocompatibility complex-I binders (``putative neoantigens'').},

Yet, intrinsic limitations of the technology result in very sparse coverage of CpG sites (around 5\% to 20\% coverage), effectively limiting the analysis repertoire to a semi-quantitative level. Here we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance. An R implementation of Melissa is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa.},

  abstract = {Equal opportunity tissue regeneration Tissue regeneration is thought to be driven primarily by rare stem cells with distinctive properties. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows rigorous testing of this hypothesis. Karthaus et al. examined the regeneration of normal prostate tissue in mice after androgen ablation, a common treatment for prostate cancer (see the Perspective by Kelly). Unexpectedly, they found that in addition to rare stem cells, a large population of differentiated cells was a major contributor to prostate regeneration, a result that they confirmed in a study of human prostate tissue. Investigation of the molecular mechanism by which the differentiated cells acquired regenerative potential yielded insights that could potentially lead to improved therapies for prostate cancer. Science, this issue p. 497; see also p. 467 Androgen deprivation is the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. It results in involution of the normal gland to \textasciitilde 90\% of its original size because of the loss of luminal cells. The prostate regenerates when androgen is restored, a process postulated to involve stem cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a rare luminal population in the mouse prostate that expresses stemlike genes (Sca1+ and Psca+) and a large population of differentiated cells (Nkx3.1+, Pbsn+). In organoids and in mice, both populations contribute equally to prostate regeneration, partly through androgen-driven expression of growth factors (Nrg2, Rspo3) by mesenchymal cells acting in a paracrine fashion on luminal cells. Analysis of human prostate tissue revealed similar differentiated and stemlike luminal subpopulations that likewise acquire enhanced regenerative potential after androgen ablation. We propose that prostate regeneration is driven by nearly all persisting luminal cells, not just by rare stem cells. After certain forms of cancer treatment, differentiated cells in the prostate gland function like tissue stem cells.

  abstract = {Differences in gene expression may play a major role in speciation and phenotypic diversity. We examined genome-wide differences in transcription factor (TF) binding in several humans and a single chimpanzee by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5\% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences. Transcription factor binding sites vary among individuals and are correlated with differences in expression. Transcription factor binding sites vary among individuals and are correlated with differences in expression.},

The population is of finite size with two competing types, which are exposed to a fixed number of environmental conditions. Reproductive rate is determined by both the type and the environment. We first calculate the condition for selection to favor the mutant relative to the resident wild type. In large populations, the mutant is favored if and only if the mutant's spatial average reproductive rate exceeds that of the resident. But environmental heterogeneity elucidates an interesting asymmetry between the mutant and the resident. Specifically, mutant heterogeneity suppresses its fixation probability; if this heterogeneity is strong enough, it can even completely offset the effects of selection (including in large populations). In contrast, resident heterogeneity has no effect on a mutant's fixation probability in large populations and can amplify it in small populations.},

At the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) locus, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) class retrotransposed upstream of the~agouti coat-color locus, providing an alternative promoter that is variably DNA methylated in genetically identical individuals. This results in variable expressivity of coat color that is inherited transgenerationally. Here, a systematic genome-wide screen identifies multiple C57BL/6J murine IAPs with Avy epigenetic properties. Each exhibits a stable methylation state within an individual but varies between individuals. Only in rare instances do they act as promoters controlling adjacent gene expression. Their methylation state is locus-specific within an individual, and their flanking regions are enriched for CTCF. Variably methylated IAPs are reprogrammed after fertilization and re-established as variable loci in the next generation, indicating reconstruction of metastable epigenetic states and challenging the generalizability of non-genetic inheritance at these regions.},

  abstract = {Computational prediction of cell type-specific, in-vivo transcription factor binding sites is still one of the central challenges in regulatory genomics, and a variety of approaches has been proposed for this purpose. Here, we present our approach that earned a shared first rank in the "ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge" in 2017. This approach employs an extensive set of features derived from chromatin accessibility, binding motifs, gene expression, sequence and annotation to train classifiers using a supervised, discriminative learning principle. Two further key aspects of this approach is learning classifier parameters in an iterative training procedure that successively adds additional negative examples to the training set, and creating an ensemble prediction by averaging over classifiers obtained for different training cell types. In post-challenge analyses, we benchmark the influence of different feature sets and find that chromatin accessiblity and binding motifs are sufficient to yield state-of-the-art performance for in-vivo binding site predictions. We also show that the iterative training procedure and the ensemble prediction are pivotal for the final prediction performance. To make predictions of this approach readily accessible, we predict 682 peak lists for a total of 31 transcription factors in 22 primary cell types and tissues, which are available for download at https://www.synapse.org/\#!Synapse:syn11526239, and we demonstrate that these predictions may help to yield biological conclusions.},

Epigenetic changes often precede disease pathology, making them valuable diagnostic indicators for disease risk or prognostic indicators for disease progression. Several inhibitors of histone deacetylation or DNA methylation are approved for hematological malignancies by the US Food and Drug Administration and have been in clinical use for several years. More recently, histone methylation and microRNA expression have gained attention as potential therapeutic targets. The presence of multiple epigenetic aberrations within malignant tissue and the abilities of cells to develop resistance suggest that epigenetic therapies are most beneficial when combined with other anticancer strategies, such as signal transduction inhibitors or cytotoxic treatments. A key challenge for future epigenetic therapies will be to develop inhibitors with specificity to particular regions of chromosomes, thereby potentially reducing side effects.},

These sequences potentially serve as natural decoys that sequester transcription factors. We have previously shown that the presence of sequences similar to the target sequence could substantially impede association of the transcription factor Egr-1 with its targets. In this study, using a stopped-flow fluorescence method, we examined the kinetic impact of DNA methylation of decoys on the search process of the Egr-1 zinc-finger protein. We analyzed its association with an unmethylated target site on fluorescence-labeled DNA in the presence of competitor DNA duplexes, including Egr-1 decoys. DNA methylation of decoys alone did not affect target search kinetics. In the presence of the MeCP2 methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), however, DNA methylation of decoys substantially ({$\sim$}10-30-fold) accelerated the target search process of the Egr-1 zinc-finger protein. This acceleration did not occur when the target was also methylated. These results suggest that when decoys are methylated, MBD proteins can block them and thereby allow Egr-1 to avoid sequestration in non-functional locations. This effect may occur in vivo for DNA methylation outside CpG islands (CGIs) and could facilitate localization of some transcription factors within regulatory CGIs, where DNA methylation is rare.},

Although modern methods profile DNA methylation at single CpG sites, methylation levels are usually averaged over  genomic regions in the downstream analyses. In this study we demonstrate that single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression compared to average promoter / gene body methylation. CpG positions with significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby (named CpG traffic lights) are evolutionary conserved and enriched for exact TSS positions and active enhancers. Among all promoter types, CpG traffic lights are especially enriched in poised promoters. Genes that harbor CpG traffic lights are associated with development and signal transduction. Methylation levels of individual CpG traffic lights vary between cell types dramatically with the increased frequency of intermediate methylation levels, indicating cell population heterogeneity in CpG methylation levels. Being in line with the concept of the inherited stochastic epigenetic variation, methylation of such CpG positions might contribute to transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that traffic lights are markers of absent gene expression resulting from inactivation of their regulatory elements. The CpG traffic lights provide a promising insight into mechanisms of enhancer activity and gene regulation linking methylation of single CpG to expression.},

However, how to exploit the predictive power of cfDNA as a liquid biopsy in the clinic remains unclear. RAS pathway aberrations can be tracked in cfDNA to monitor resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this prospective phase II clinical trial of single-agent cetuximab in RAS wild-type patients, we combine genomic profiling of serial cfDNA and matched sequential tissue biopsies with imaging and mathematical modeling of cancer evolution. We show that a significant proportion of patients defined as RAS wild-type based on diagnostic tissue analysis harbor aberrations in the RAS pathway in pretreatment cfDNA and, in fact, do not benefit from EGFR inhibition. We demonstrate that primary and acquired resistance to cetuximab are often of polyclonal nature, and these dynamics can be observed in tissue and plasma. Furthermore, evolutionary modeling combined with frequent serial sampling of cfDNA allows prediction of the expected time to treatment failure in individual patients. This study demonstrates how integrating frequently sampled longitudinal liquid biopsies with a mathematical framework of tumor evolution allows individualized quantitative forecasting of progression, providing novel opportunities for adaptive personalized therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Liquid biopsies capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity underpinning resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer. Dense serial sampling is needed to predict the time to treatment failure and generate a window of opportunity for intervention. Cancer Discov; 8(10); 1\textendash 16. \textcopyright 2018 AACR.},

Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells results in a high level of immature malignant cells and fewer differentiated red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. The disease occurs at all ages, but predominantly occurs in older people ({$>$}60 years of age). AML typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms that are attributable to bone marrow failure and may be fatal within weeks or months when left untreated. The genomic landscape of AML has been determined and genetic instability is infrequent with a relatively small number of driver mutations. Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation are common and are early events in leukaemogenesis. The subclassification of AML has been dependent on the morphology and cytogenetics of blood and bone marrow cells, but specific mutational analysis is now being incorporated. Improvements in treatment in younger patients over the past 35 years has largely been due to dose escalation and better supportive care. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be used to consolidate remission in those patients who are deemed to be at high risk of relapse. A plethora of new agents \textemdash{} including those targeted at specific biochemical pathways and immunotherapeutic approaches \textemdash{} are now in trial based on improved understanding of disease pathophysiology.

Upon chromosomal rearrangement,               G2DHE               acquires characteristics of a super-enhancer and causes overexpression of               EVI1               at 3q26.2. However, the transcription factor (TF) complex of               G2DHE               remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to unravel key components of               G2DHE               -bound TFs involved in the deregulation of               EVI1               . We have identified several CEBPA and RUNX1 binding sites to be enriched and critical for               G2DHE               function in 3q-AML cells. Using ChIP-SICAP (ChIP followed by selective isolation of chromatin-associated proteins), a panel of chromatin interactors of RUNX1 and CEBPA were detected in 3q-AML, including PARP1 and IKZF1. PARP1 inhibition (PARPi) caused a reduction of               EVI1               expression and a decrease in               EVI1               \textendash{}               G2DHE               interaction frequency, highlighting the involvement of PARP1 in oncogenic super-enhancer formation. Furthermore, 3q-AML cells were highly sensitive to PARPi and displayed morphological changes with higher rates of differentiation and apoptosis as well as depletion of CD34\,+\,cells. In summary, integrative analysis of the 3q-AML super-enhancer complex identified CEBPA and RUNX1 associated proteins and nominated PARP1 as a potential new therapeutic target in               EVI1               \,+\,3q-AML.},

In vertebrates, insulator's function requires association with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a protein that recognizes long and diverse nucleotide sequences. While insulators are critical in gene~regulation, only a few have been reported. Here, we describe 13,804 CTCF-binding sites in potential insulators of the human genome, discovered experimentally in primary human fibroblasts. Most of these sequences are located far from the transcriptional start sites, with their distribution strongly correlated with genes. The majority of them fit to a consensus motif highly conserved and suitable for predicting possible insulators driven by CTCF in other vertebrate genomes. In addition, CTCF localization is largely invariant across different cell types. Our results provide a resource for investigating insulator function and possible other general and evolutionarily conserved activities of CTCF sites.},

Here we identified a set of mutations arising in individual samples and altering different cis-regulatory elements that converge on a common gene via chromatin interactions. The mutations and genes identified in this fashion showed strong relevance to cancer, in contrast to noncoding mutations with site-specific recurrence only. We developed a prediction method that identifies potentially recurrent mutations on the basis of the features shared by mutations whose recurrence is observed in a given cohort. Our method was capable of accurately predicting recurrent mutations at the level of target genes but not mutations recurring at the same site. We experimentally validated predicted mutations in distal regulatory regions of the TERT gene. In conclusion, we propose a novel approach to discovering potential cancer-driving mutations in noncoding regions.},

The catalytic domain is homologous to prokaryotic (cytosine-5) methyltransferases and contains the catalytic PC dipeptide, while the N-terminus acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting several chromatin remodeling proteins. Here, we show that the human de novo enzymes hDNMT3a and hDNMT3b form complexes with the major maintenance enzyme hDNMT1. Antibodies against hDNMT1 pull down both the de novo enzymes. Furthermore, the N-termini of the enzymes are involved in protein-protein interactions. Immunocytochemical staining revealed mostly nuclear co-localization of the fusion proteins, with the exception of hDNMT3a, which is found either exclusively in cytoplasm or in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Pre-methylated substrate DNAs exhibited differential methylation by de novo and maintenance enzymes. In vivo co-expression of hDNMT1 and hDNMT3a or hDNMT3b leads to methylation spreading in the genome, suggesting co-operation between de novo and maintenance enzymes during DNA methylation.},

Using computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 3,212 cancer patients, we show that ecDNA amplification frequently occurs in most cancer types but not in blood or normal tissue. Oncogenes were highly enriched on amplified ecDNA, and the most common recurrent oncogene amplifications arose on ecDNA. EcDNA amplifications resulted in higher levels of oncogene transcription compared to copy number-matched linear DNA, coupled with enhanced chromatin accessibility, and more frequently resulted in transcript fusions. Patients whose cancers carried ecDNA had significantly shorter survival, even when controlled for tissue type, than patients whose cancers were not driven by ecDNA-based oncogene amplification. The results presented here demonstrate that ecDNA-based oncogene amplification is common in cancer, is different from chromosomal amplification and drives poor outcome for patients across many cancer types.},

The clinical progression of CLL is heterogeneous and ranges from patients who require treatment soon after diagnosis to others who do not require therapy for many years, if at all. Several factors, including the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status, genomic changes, patient age and the presence of comorbidities, should be considered when defining the optimal management strategies, which include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and/or drugs targeting B cell receptor signalling or inhibitors of apoptosis, such as BCL-2. Research on the biology of CLL has profoundly enhanced our ability to identify patients who are at higher risk for disease progression and our capacity to treat patients with drugs that selectively target distinctive phenotypic or physiological features of CLL. How these and other advances have shaped our current understanding and treatment of patients with CLL is the subject of this Primer.},

Subclones showed variable engraftment potential in immunodeficient mice. Xenografts were predominantly comprised of a single genetically defined subclone, but there was no predictable relationship between the engrafting subclone and the evolutionary hierarchy of the leukemia.

Currently, prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage is exceedingly difficult; patients rarely exhibit symptoms and tumours do not display sensitive and specific markers to aid detection. Pancreatic cancers also have few prevalent genetic mutations; the most commonly mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A (encoding p16), TP53 and SMAD4 \textemdash{} none of which are currently druggable. Indeed, therapeutic options are limited and progress in drug development is impeded because most pancreatic cancers are complex at the genomic, epigenetic and metabolic levels, with multiple activated pathways and crosstalk evident. Furthermore, the multilayered interplay between neoplastic and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment challenges medical treatment. Fewer than 20\% of patients have surgically resectable disease; however, neoadjuvant therapies might shift tumours towards resectability. Although newer drug combinations and multimodal regimens in this setting, as well as the adjuvant setting, appreciably extend survival, {$\sim$}80\% of patients will relapse after surgery and ultimately die of their disease. Thus, consideration of quality of life and overall survival is important. In this Primer, we summarize the current understanding of the salient pathophysiological, molecular, translational and clinical aspects of this disease.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The need to understand cell developmental processes has spawned a plethora of computational methods for discovering hierarchies from scRNAseq data. However, existing techniques are based on Euclidean geometry which is not an optimal choice for modeling complex cell trajectories with multiple branches. To overcome this fundamental representation issue we propose Poincar\'e maps, a method harnessing the power of hyperbolic geometry into the realm of single-cell data analysis. Often understood as a continuous extension of trees, hyperbolic geometry enables the embedding of complex hierarchical data in as few as two dimensions and well-preserves distances between points in the hierarchy. This enables direct exploratory analysis and the use of our embeddings in a wide variety of downstream data analysis tasks, such as visualization, clustering, lineage detection and pseudotime inference. In contrast to existing methods \textendash{} which are not able to cover all those important aspects in a single embedding \textendash{} we show that Poincar\'e maps produce state-of-the-art two-dimensional representations of cell trajectories on multiple scRNAseq datasets. Specifically, we demonstrate that Poincar\'e maps allow in a straightforward manner to formulate new hypotheses about biological processes which were not visible with the methods introduced before. Moreover, we show that our embeddings can be used to learn predictive models that estimate gene expressions of unseen cell populations in intermediate developmental stages.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Significance statement{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The discovery of hierarchies in biological processes is central to developmental biology.

In particular, we suggest that when natural selection acts on pure epigenetic variation in addition to genetic variation, populations adapt faster, and adaptive phenotypes can arise before any genetic changes. This may make it difficult to reconcile the timing of adaptive events detected using conventional population genetics tools based on DNA sequence data with environmental drivers of adaptation, such as changes in climate. Epigenetic modifications are frequently associated with somatic cell differentiation, but recently epigenetic changes have been found that can be transmitted over many generations. Here, we show how the interplay of these heritable epigenetic changes with genetic changes can affect adaptive evolution, and how epigenetic changes affect the signature of selection in the genetic record.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architectural changes can alter the integrity of topologically associated domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer-promoter interactions impacting gene expression. Recently, such alterations have been implicated in human disease, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of their role. Here, we investigate the reorganization of chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using primary human leukemia specimens and its dynamic responses to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-Seq and CTCF ChIP-Seq datasets revealed widespread changes in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD "fusion" event being associated with loss of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data show that small molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation reduce specific 3D interactions associated with transformation. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}One of the most ubiquitous analysis tools employed in single-cell transcriptomics and cytometry is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), used to visualize individual cells as points on a 2D scatter plot such that similar cells are positioned close together. Recently, a related algorithm, called uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) has attracted substantial attention in the single-cell community. In Nature Biotechnology, Becht et al. argued that UMAP is preferable to t-SNE because it better preserves the global structure of the data and is more consistent across runs. Here we show that this alleged superiority of UMAP can be entirely attributed to different choices of initialization in the implementations used by Becht et al.: t-SNE implementations by default used random initialization, while the UMAP implementation used a technique called Laplacian eigenmaps to initialize the embedding. We show that UMAP with random initialization preserves global structure as poorly as t-SNE with random initialization, while t-SNE with informative initialization performs as well as UMAP with informative initialization. Hence, contrary to the claims of Becht et al., their experiments do not demonstrate any advantage of the UMAP algorithm per se, but rather warn against using random initialization.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, DNA methylation profiles have not been compared on a large scale between prostate tumor and normal prostate, and the mechanisms behind these alterations are unknown. In this study, we quantitatively profiled 95 primary prostate tumors and 86 benign adjacent prostate tissue samples for their DNA methylation levels at 26,333 CpGs representing 14,104 gene promoters by using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 platform. A 2-class Significance Analysis of this data set revealed 5912 CpG sites with increased DNA methylation and 2151 CpG sites with decreased DNA methylation in tumors (FDR {$<$} 0.8\%). Prediction Analysis of this data set identified 87 CpGs that are the most predictive diagnostic methylation biomarkers of prostate cancer. By integrating available clinical follow-up data, we also identified 69 prognostic DNA methylation alterations that correlate with biochemical recurrence of the tumor. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors. Subsequent transient transfection assays in cultured primary prostate cells revealed that DNMT3B1 and DNMT3B2 overexpression resulted in increased methylation of a substantial subset of CpG sites that showed tumor-specific increased methylation.},

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of colon cancer initiation. We outline the processes and rate constants that determine the fraction of colon cancers where MIN or CIN mutations precede the inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. For a wide range of parameter values, we find support for the radical hypothesis that genetic instability initiates colonic tumorigenesis.

In this case, the evolutionary dynamics can be approximated by a low-dimensional stochastic process with a linear Kolmogorov forward equation that can be solved analytically. Most of the time, the cell population is homogeneous with respect to relevant mutations. Occasionally, such homogeneous states are connected by `stochastic tunnels'. We give a precise analysis of the existence of tunnels and calculate the rate of tunneling. Finally, we calculate the conditions for chromosomal instability (CIN) to precede inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. In this case, CIN is an early event and a driving force of cancer progression.

  abstract = {The scientific community is increasingly embracing open science. This growing commitment to open science should be applauded and encouraged, especially when it occurs voluntarily and prior to peer review. Thanks to other researchers' dedication to open science, we have had the privilege of conducting a reanalysis of a landmark experiment published as a preprint with data made available in a public repository. The study in question found that promoter DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to induce transcriptional repression, which appears to contradict a large body of observational studies showing a strong association between DNA methylation and gene expression. This study was the first to evaluate whether forcibly methylating thousands of DNA promoter regions is sufficient to suppress gene expression. The authors' data analysis did not find a strong relationship between promoter methylation and transcriptional repression. However, their analyses did not make full use of statistical inference and applied a normalization technique that removes global differences that are representative of the actual biological system. Here we reanalyze the data with an approach that includes statistical inference of differentially methylated regions, as well as a normalization technique that accounts for global expression differences. We find that forced DNA methylation of thousands of promoters overwhelmingly represses gene expression. In addition, we show that complementary epigenetic marks of active transcription are reduced as a result of DNA methylation. Finally, by studying whether these associations are sensitive to the CG density of promoters, we find no substantial differences in the association between promoters with and without a CG island. The code needed to reproduce are analysis is included in the public GitHub repository github.com/kdkorthauer/repressivecapacity.},

However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another.

In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of \$20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion.

Therefore, a picture is emerging in which diseases and traits are often the consequence of erroneous wiring of regulatory circuitry between enhancers and their target genes.Enhancers communicate with distant target genes through chromatin loops. Such transcription regulatory loops are formed within topologically associated domains (TADs), the structural and functional units of the chromosomes.Disrupting enhancer\textendash promoter loops, as well as TAD boundaries, can lead to gene dysregulation and disease, the latter due to previously insulated genes and enhancers being released to form new regulatory chromatin loops.Technological advances and the availability of increasingly detailed genomic contact maps generated by Hi-C are enabling the elucidation of the physical contacts between genes and non-coding sequences in different cell types, which greatly facilitates the assigning of function to disease-associated genetic variation.We present a roadmap \textemdash{} from disease-associated genetic variants to molecular mechanisms causing disease \textemdash{} that proposes to integrate epigenetic data with detailed 3D genome information and haplotype-resolved expression analysis to help move results descriptive genetic association studies towards the discovery of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease.},

Whereas gene-proximal promoters are typically active across numerous cell types, distal enhancer activation is cell-type-specific and central to cell fate determination, thereby accounting for cell identity. Recent studies have highlighted the diversity of enhancer usage, cataloguing millions of such elements in the human genome. The disruption of enhancer activity, through genetic or epigenetic alterations, can impact cell-type-specific functions, resulting in a wide range of pathologies. In cancer, these alterations can promote a `cell identity crisis, in which enhancers associated with oncogenes and multipotentiality are activated, while those promoting cell fate commitment are inactivated. Overall, these alterations favor an undifferentiated cellular phenotype. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of enhancers in normal cell function, and discuss how genetic and epigenetic changes in enhancer elements potentiate oncogenesis. In addition, we discuss how understanding the mechanisms regulating enhancer activity can inform therapeutic opportunities in cancer cells and highlight key challenges that remain in understanding enhancer biology as it relates to oncology.},

This difference is mediated by ERG co-option of HOXB13 and FOXA1, implementing a T2E-specific transcriptional profile. We also report a T2E-specific CORE on the structurally rearranged ERG locus arising from spreading of the TMPRSS2 locus pre-existing CORE, assisting in its overexpression. Finally, we show that the T2E-specific cis-regulatory landscape underlies a vulnerability against the NOTCH pathway. Indeed, NOTCH pathway inhibition antagonizes the growth and invasion of T2E-positive prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our work shows that overexpressed ERG co-opts master transcription factors to deploy a unique cis-regulatory landscape, inducing a druggable dependency on NOTCH signaling in T2E-positive prostate tumors.},

New treatments for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer have emerged, providing additional options for patients; these treatments include laparoscopic surgery for primary disease, more-aggressive resection of metastatic disease (such as liver and pulmonary metastases), radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapies. However, these new treatment options have had limited impact on cure rates and long-term survival.

Although DNA methylation and gene expression were poorly correlated, we identified gene-body CpG dinucleotides whose methylation was positively or negatively associated with expression.

  abstract = {Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are somatically mosaic and contribute to intercellular heterogeneity in normal and tumor cells. Because short eccDNAs are poorly chromatinized, we hypothesized that they are sequenced by tagmentation in ATAC-seq experiments without any enrichment of circular DNA. Indeed, ATAC-seq identified thousands of eccDNAs in cell lines that were validated by inverse PCR and by metaphase FISH. ATAC-seq in gliomas and glioblastomas identify hundreds of eccDNAs, including one containing the well-known EGFR gene amplicon from chr7. More than 18,000 eccDNAs, many carrying known cancer driver genes, are identified in a pan-cancer analysis of ATAC-seq libraries from 23 tumor types. Somatically mosaic eccDNAs are identified by ATAC-seq even before amplification is recognized by genome-wide copy number variation measurements. Thus, ATAC-seq is a sensitive method to detect eccDNA present in a tumor at the pre-amplification stage and can be used to predict resistance to therapy.},

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made when clear end-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell proliferative disorder or when findings that suggest a high likelihood of their development are present. Distinguishing symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires treatment from the precursor stages of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma is important, as observation is the standard for those conditions. Much progress has been made over the past decade in the understanding of disease biology and individualized treatment approaches. Several new classes of drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, have joined the traditional armamentarium (corticosteroids, alkylating agents and anthracyclines) and, along with high-dose therapy and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, have led to deeper and durable clinical responses. Indeed, an increasing proportion of patients are achieving lasting remissions, raising the possibility of cure for this disease. Success will probably depend on using combinations of effective agents and treating patients in the early stages of disease, such as patients with smouldering multiple myeloma.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have reported that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and ten-eleven-translocation (TET) family members regulate active DNA demethylation. Genetic alterations of TET2 occur in myeloid malignancies, and hematopoietic-specific loss of Tet2 induces aberrant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal/differentiation, implicating TET2 as a master regulator of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Despite the functional link between AID and TET in epigenetic gene regulation, the role of AID loss in hematopoiesis and myeloid transformation remains to be investigated. Here, we show that Aid loss in mice leads to expansion of myeloid cells and reduced erythroid progenitors resulting in anemia, with dysregulated expression of Cebpa and Gata1, myeloid/erythroid lineage-specific transcription factors. Consistent with data in the murine context, silencing of AID in human bone marrow cells skews differentiation toward myelomonocytic lineage. However, in contrast to Tet2 loss, Aid loss does not contribute to enhanced HSC self-renewal or cooperate with Flt3-ITD to induce myeloid transformation. Genome-wide transcription and differential methylation analysis uncover the critical role of Aid as a key epigenetic regulator. These results indicate that AID and TET2 share common effects on myeloid and erythroid lineage differentiation, however, their role is nonredundant in regulating HSC self-renewal and in myeloid transformation.},

  abstract = {Recent genetic analyses have revealed that premalignant somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells are common in older people without an evidence of hematologic malignancies, leading to clonal hematopoietic expansion. This phenomenon has been termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Frequency of such clonal somatic mutations increases with age: in 5-10\% of people older than 70~years and around 20\% of people older than 90~years. The most commonly mutated genes found in individuals with CHIP were epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), Ten-eleven-translocation 2 (TET2), and Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), which are also recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Recent functional studies have uncovered pleiotropic effect of mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 in hematopoietic stem cell regulation and leukemic transformation. Of note, CHIP is associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancy and all-cause mortality, albeit the annual risk of leukemic transformation was relatively low (0.5-1\%). These findings suggest that clonal hematopoiesis per se may not be sufficient to engender preleukemic state. Further studies are required to decipher the exact mechanism by which preleukemic stem cells originate and transform into a full-blown leukemic state.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic inheritance, the transmission of gene expression states from parent to daughter cells, often involves methylation of DNA. In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a frequent component of epigenetic mechanisms. Failure to transmit faithfully a methylated or an unmethylated state of cytosine can lead to altered phenotypes in plants and animals. A central unresolved question in epigenetics concerns the mechanisms by which a locus maintains, or changes, its state of cytosine methylation. We developed "hairpin-bisulfite PCR" to analyze these mechanisms. This method reveals the extent of methylation symmetry between the complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Using hairpin-bisulfite PCR, we determined the fidelity of methylation transmission in the CpG island of the FMR1 gene in human lymphocytes. For the hypermethylated CpG island of this gene, characteristic of inactive-X alleles, we estimate a maintenance methylation efficiency of approximately 0.96 per site per cell division. For de novo methylation efficiency (E(d)), remarkably different estimates were obtained for the hypermethylated CpG island (E(d) = 0.17), compared with the hypomethylated island on the active-X chromosome (E(d) {$<$} 0.01). These results clarify the mechanisms by which the alternative hypomethylated and hypermethylated states of CpG islands are stably maintained through many cell divisions. We also analyzed a region of human L1 transposable elements. These L1 data provide accurate methylation patterns for the complementary strand of each repeat sequence analyzed. Hairpin-bisulfite PCR will be a powerful tool in studying other processes for which genetic or epigenetic information differs on the two complementary strands of DNA.},

Here, we show that methylation patterns within populations of cells from individual somatic tissues are heterogeneous and polymorphic. Using in vitro evolution of immortalized fibroblasts for over 300 generations, we track the dynamics of polymorphic methylation at regions developing significant differential methylation on average. The data indicate that changes in population-averaged methylation occur through a stochastic process that generates a stream of local and uncorrelated methylation aberrations. Despite the stochastic nature of the process, nearly deterministic epigenetic remodeling emerges on average at loci that lose or gain resistance to methylation accumulation. Changes in the susceptibility to methylation accumulation are correlated with changes in histone modification and CTCF occupancy. Characterizing epigenomic polymorphism within cell populations is therefore critical to understanding methylation dynamics in normal and cancer cells.},

Recently, genome-wide technologies have been intensively applied to CLL genetics, with remarkable progress. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays have identified recurring chromosomal aberrations, thereby focusing functional studies on discrete genomic lesions and leading to the first implication of somatic microRNA disruption in cancer. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has further transformed our understanding of CLL by identifying novel recurrently mutated putative drivers, including the unexpected discovery of somatic mutations affecting spliceosome function. NGS has further enabled in-depth examination of the transcriptional and epigenetic changes in CLL that accompany genetic lesions, and has shed light on how different driver events appear at different stages of disease progression and clonally evolve with relapsed disease. In addition to providing important insights into disease biology, these discoveries have significant translational potential. They enhance prognosis by highlighting specific lesions associated with poor clinical outcomes (for example, driver events such as mutations in the splicing factor subunit gene SF3B1) or with increased clonal heterogeneity (for example, the presence of subclonal driver mutations). Here, we review new genomic discoveries in CLL and discuss their possible implications in the era of precision medicine.},

We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.},

Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.},

Lander and M. Waterman (Genomics 2: 231-239, 1988) gave a mathematical analysis of such mapping strategies. The analysis is useful for comparing various fingerprinting methods. Recently it has been proposed that ends of clones rather than the entire clone be fingerprinted or characterized. Such fingerprints, which include sequenced clone ends, require a mathematical analysis deeper than that of Lander-Waterman. This paper studies clone islands, which can include uncharacterized regions, and also the islands that are formed entirely from the ends of clones. ?? 1995.},

However, the origin of intratumoural functional heterogeneity between glioblastoma cells remains poorly understood. Here we study the clonal evolution of barcoded glioblastoma cells in an unbiased way following serial xenotransplantation to define their individual fate behaviours. Independent of an evolving mutational signature, we show that the growth of glioblastoma clones in vivo is consistent with a remarkably neutral process involving a conserved proliferative hierarchy rooted in glioblastoma stem cells. In this model, slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, which in turn generates non-proliferative cells. We also identify rare `outlier' clones that deviate from these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy facilitates the expansion of pre-existing drug-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. Finally, we show that functionally distinct glioblastoma stem cells can be separately targeted using epigenetic compounds, suggesting new avenues for glioblastoma-targeted therapy.},

Lara-Astiaso et al. studied this phenomenon in blood. They developed a technique that examines a relatively small number of cells to identify the changes that affect DNA during blood development. They found that the DNA of noncoding regions, called enhancers, is set in an open position when cells are undifferentiated and able to take on a variety of roles and gradually closes as cells mature into their final forms. Science, this issue p. 943 Chromatin modifications are crucial for development, yet little is known about their dynamics during differentiation. Hematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study chromatin state dynamics; however, technical limitations impede profiling of homogeneous differentiation intermediates. We developed a high-sensitivity indexing-first chromatin immunoprecipitation approach to profile the dynamics of four chromatin modifications across 16 stages of hematopoietic differentiation. We identify 48,415 enhancer regions and characterize their dynamics. We find that lineage commitment involves de novo establishment of 17,035 lineage-specific enhancers. These enhancer repertoire expansions foreshadow transcriptional programs in differentiated cells. Combining our enhancer catalog with gene expression profiles, we elucidate the transcription factor network controlling chromatin dynamics and lineage specification in hematopoiesis. Together, our results provide a comprehensive model of chromatin dynamics during development. A chromatin precipitation technique identifies changes during the differentiation of blood cells.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie  on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the  structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Recent studies have implicated changes in DNA methylation and small RNAs in hybrid performance; however, it remains unclear whether epigenetic changes are a cause or a consequence of heterosis. Here, we analyze a large panel of over 500 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) epigenetic hybrid plants (epiHybrids), which we derived from near-isogenic but epigenetically divergent parents. This proof-of-principle experimental system allowed us to quantify the contribution of parental methylation differences to heterosis. We measured traits such as leaf area, growth rate, flowering time, main stem branching, rosette branching, and final plant height and observed several strong positive and negative heterotic phenotypes among the epiHybrids. Using an epigenetic quantitative trait locus mapping approach, we were able to identify specific differentially methylated regions in the parental genomes that are associated with hybrid performance. Sequencing of methylomes, transcriptomes, and genomes of selected parent-epiHybrid combinations further showed that these parental differentially methylated regions most likely mediate the remodeling of methylation and transcriptional states at specific loci in the hybrids. Taken together, our data suggest that locus-specific epigenetic divergence between the parental lines can directly or indirectly trigger heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids independent of genetic changes. These results add to a growing body of evidence that points to epigenetic factors as one of the key determinants of hybrid performance.},

Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600\textendash 5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

For one signature miRNA, miR-126, high bioactivity aggregated all in vivo patient sample LSC activity into a single sorted population, tightly coupling miR-126 expression to LSC function. Through functional studies, miR-126 was found to restrain cell cycle progression, prevent differentiation, and increase self-renewal of primary LSC in~vivo. Compared with prior results showing miR-126 regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, these functional stem effects are opposite between LSC and HSC. Combined transcriptome and proteome analysis demonstrates that miR-126 targets the PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling pathway, preserving LSC quiescence and promoting chemotherapy resistance.},

  abstract = {Aneuploidy is associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. Spontaneous chromosome missegregation events in aneuploid cells promote chromosomal instability (CIN) that may contribute to the acquisition of multidrug resistance in vitro and heighten risk for tumor relapse in animal models. Identification of distinct therapeutic agents that target tumor karyotypic complexity has important clinical implications. To identify distinct therapeutic approaches to specifically limit the growth of CIN tumors, we focused on a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, previously classified as either chromosomally unstable (CIN(+)) or diploid/near-diploid (CIN(-)), and treated them individually with a library of kinase inhibitors targeting components of signal transduction, cell cycle, and transmembrane receptor signaling pathways. CIN(+) cell lines displayed significant intrinsic multidrug resistance compared with CIN(-) cancer cell lines, and this seemed to be independent of somatic mutation status and proliferation rate. Confirming the association of CIN rather than ploidy status with multidrug resistance, tetraploid isogenic cells that had arisen from diploid cell lines displayed lower drug sensitivity than their diploid parental cells only with increasing chromosomal heterogeneity and isogenic cell line models of CIN(+) displayed multidrug resistance relative to their CIN(-) parental cancer cell line derivatives. In a meta-analysis of CRC outcome following cytotoxic treatment, CIN(+) predicted worse progression-free or disease-free survival relative to patients with CIN(-) disease. Our results suggest that stratifying tumor responses according to CIN status should be considered within the context of clinical trials to minimize the confounding effects of tumor CIN status on drug sensitivity.},

Methods for detection of single-cell epigenomic variation such as DNA methylation sequencing and ATAC-seq hold tremendous promise for delineating distinct cell types and identifying their critical cis-regulatory sequences. Emerging evidence has shown that in addition to cis-regulatory sequences, dynamic regulation of 3D chromatin conformation is a critical mechanism for the modulation of gene expression during development and disease. It remains unclear whether single-cell Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) or Hi-C profiles are suitable for cell type identification and allow the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps. To address these challenges, we have developed a multi-omic method single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (sn-m3C-seq) to profile chromatin conformation and DNA methylation from the same cell. We have shown that bulk m3C-seq and sn-m3C-seq accurately capture chromatin organization information and robustly separate mouse cell types. We have developed a fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting strategy based on DNA content that eliminates nuclei multiplets caused by crosslinking. The sn-m3C-seq method allows high-resolution cell-type classification using two orthogonal types of epigenomic information and the reconstruction of cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps.},

The amino-acid and nucleotide sequences deposited in the GenBank and SwissProt databases were subjected to analysis using the following bioinformatic programs: ClustalX, GeneDoc, MEGA2 and S.I.F.T. (sort intolerant from tolerant). Phylogenetic trees of enolases created with the use of the MEGA2 program show evolutionary relationships and functional diversity of the three isoforms of enolase in vertebrates. On the basis of calculations and the phylogenetic trees it can be concluded that vertebrate enolase has evolved according to the "birth and death" model of evolution. An analysis of amino acid sequences of enolases: non-neuronal (NNE), neuron specific (NSE) and muscle specific (MSE) using the S.I.F.T. program indicated non-uniform number of possible substitutions. Tolerated substitutions occur most frequently in alpha-enolase, while the lowest number of substitutions has accumulated in gamma-enolase, which may suggest that it is the most recently evolved isoenzyme of enolase in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Messenger RNA expression is important in normal development and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease. RNA-seq experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer are available for identifying DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently, application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.Results: Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian methods, we have developed EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms in an RNA-seq experiment comparing two or more biological conditions. Results demonstrate substantially improved power and performance of EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms. EBSeq also proves to be a robust approach for identifying DE genes.Availability and implementation: An R package containing examples and sample datasets is available at http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/{$\sim$}kendzior/EBSEQ/.Contact:kendzior@biostat.wisc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

By making direct torque measurements, we demonstrate that the intrinsic mechanical properties of chromatin play a fundamental role in dictating precatenane formation and regulating chromatin topology. Whereas a single chromatin fiber is torsionally soft, a braided fiber is torsionally stiff, indicating that supercoiling on chromatin substrates is preferentially directed in front of the fork during replication. We further show that topoisomerase II relaxation displays a strong preference for a single chromatin fiber over a braided fiber.

Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons.

  abstract = {Background The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. Methods Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. Results A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1\%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7\%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P{$<$}0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. Conclusions DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

However, the whole-genome chromatin conformation changes that occur during leukemia cell differentiation are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the changes in chromatin conformation, histone states, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression using an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation model. The results showed that the boundaries of topological associated domains (TADs) were stable during differentiation; however, the chromatin conformations within several specific TADs were obviously changed. By combining H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and Hi-C signals, we annotated the differential gene-regulatory chromatin interactions upon ATRA induction. The gains and losses of the gene-regulatory chromatin interactions are significantly correlated with gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Finally, we found that the loss of GATA2 expression and DNA binding are crucial for the differentiation process, and changes in the chromatin structure around the GATA2 regulate its expression upon ATRA induction. This study provided both statistical insights and experimental details regarding the relationship between chromatin conformation changes and transcription regulation during leukemia cell differentiation, and the results suggested that the chromatin conformation is a new type of potential drug target for cancer therapy.},

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation and drug resistance may reveal opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Here we show that GSCs can reversibly transition to a slow-cycling, persistent state in response to targeted kinase inhibitors. In this state, GSCs upregulate primitive developmental programs and are dependent upon Notch signaling. This transition is accompanied by widespread redistribution of~repressive histone methylation. Accordingly, persister GSCs upregulate, and are dependent on, the histone demethylases KDM6A/B. Slow-cycling cells with high Notch activity and histone demethylase expression are present in primary glioblastomas before treatment, potentially contributing to relapse. Our findings illustrate how cancer cells may hijack aspects of native developmental programs for deranged proliferation, adaptation, and tolerance. They also suggest strategies for~eliminating refractory tumor cells by targeting epigenetic and developmental pathways.},

This is particularly important because even at the recommend 30X coverage for reference methylomes, up to 50\% of high-resolution features such as differentially methylated positions (DMPs) cannot be called with current methods as determined by saturation analysis. To address this limitation, we have developed a tool that dynamically segments WGBS methylomes into blocks of comethylation (COMETs) from which lost information can be recovered in the form of differentially methylated COMETs (DMCs). Using this tool, we demonstrate recovery of {$\sim$}30\% of the lost DMP information content as DMCs even at very low (5X) coverage. This constitutes twice the amount that can be recovered using an existing method based on differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In addition, we explored the relationship between COMETs and haplotypes in lymphoblastoid cell lines of African and European origin. Using best fit analysis, we show COMETs to be correlated in a population-specific manner, suggesting that this type of dynamic segmentation may be useful for integrated (epi)genome-wide association studies in the future.},

We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.

This observation provides a fundamental insight into the inter-regulation between enhancers and promoters, which can both act as transcription units; it also raises crucial questions regarding the potential biological roles of the enhancer transcription process and non-coding enhancer RNAs.

Here, we review recent advances in genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity and clonal dynamics in AML and their relevance to biology, clinical outcomes and therapeutic implications. Special attention is focused on somatic mutations affecting regulators of cytosine methylation, since these tend to occur early in disease evolution, reprogram the epigenome of hematopoietic stem cells, and are linked to unfavorable outcome.},

Here we describe enhanced CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic editing systems, enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi, for multiplexed analysis of enhancer function in situ and in vivo. Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the new systems display more robust perturbation of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Multiplexed perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoietic lineage specification. Hence, enhanced CRSIPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The sequence of the methylation states of cytosines on any given read forms a methylation pattern that carries substantially more information than merely studying the average methylation level at individual positions. In order to understand better the complexity of DNA methylation landscapes in biological samples, it is important to study the diversity of these methylation patterns. However, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is subject to sequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite conversion of cytosines. RESULTS A statistical model is developed which accounts for the distribution of DNA methylation patterns at any given locus. The model incorporates the effects of sequencing errors and spurious reads, and enables estimation of the true underlying distribution of methylation patterns. CONCLUSIONS Calculation of the estimated distribution over methylation patterns is implemented in the R Bioconductor package MPFE.

  abstract = {Mutations in protein-coding genes are well established as the basis for human cancer, yet how alterations within noncoding genome, a substantial fraction of which contain cis-regulatory elements (CRE), contribute to cancer pathophysiology remains elusive. Here, we developed an integrative approach to systematically identify and characterize noncoding regulatory variants with functional consequences in human hematopoietic malignancies. Combining targeted resequencing of hematopoietic lineage\textendash associated CREs and mutation discovery, we uncovered 1,836 recurrently mutated CREs containing leukemia-associated noncoding variants. By enhanced CRISPR/dCas9\textendash based CRE perturbation screening and functional analyses, we identified 218 variant-associated oncogenic or tumor-suppressive CREs in human leukemia. Noncoding variants at KRAS and PER2 enhancers reside in proximity to nuclear receptor (NR) binding regions and modulate transcriptional activities in response to NR signaling in leukemia cells. NR binding sites frequently colocalize with noncoding variants across cancer types. Hence, recurrent noncoding variants connect enhancer dysregulation with nuclear receptor signaling in hematopoietic malignancies. Significance: We describe an integrative approach to identify noncoding variants in human leukemia, and reveal cohorts of variant-associated oncogenic and tumor-suppressive cis-regulatory elements including KRAS and PER2 enhancers. Our findings support a model in which noncoding regulatory variants connect enhancer dysregulation with nuclear receptor signaling to modulate gene programs in hematopoietic malignancies.See related commentary by van Galen, p. 646.},

Image subtraction, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance were significantly better for TAD difference detection than the others.

Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

The methyltransferase activity of MLL1, by itself severely compromised, is stimulated by the three conserved factors WDR5, RBBP5 and ASH2L, which are shared by all MLL family complexes. However, the molecular mechanism of how these factors regulate the activity of MLL proteins still remains poorly understood. Here we show that a minimized human RBBP5\textendash ASH2L heterodimer is the structural unit that interacts with and activates all MLL family histone methyltransferases. Our structural, biochemical and computational analyses reveal a two-step activation mechanism of MLL family proteins. These findings provide unprecedented insights into the common theme and functional plasticity in complex assembly and activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases, and also suggest a universal regulation mechanism for most histone methyltransferases.},

A 2.6~\AA{} crystal structure of SA2-SCC1 in complex with CTCF reveals the molecular basis of the interaction. We demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for CTCF-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. A similar motif is present in a number of established and novel cohesin ligands, including the cohesin release factor WAPL2,3. Our data suggest that CTCF enables chromatin loop formation by protecting cohesin against loop release. These results provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanism that enables dynamic regulation of chromatin folding by cohesin and CTCF.},

Epigenomic variation at the single-cell level can rapidly create cancer heterogeneity but is difficult to detect and assess functionally.

Using single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq data in K562 leukemic cells, we identify the cell surface marker CD24 as co-varying with chromatin accessibility changes linked to GATA transcription factors in single cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD24 high versus low cells prospectively isolated GATA1 and GATA2 high versus low cells. GATA high versus low cells express differential gene regulatory networks, differential sensitivity to the drug imatinib mesylate, and differential self-renewal capacity. Lineage tracing experiments show that GATA/CD24hi cells have the capability to rapidly reconstitute the heterogeneity within the entire starting population, suggesting that GATA expression levels drive a phenotypically relevant source of epigenomic plasticity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility can guide prospective characterization of cancer heterogeneity.

  abstract = {A comprehensive characterization of tumor genetic heterogeneity is critical for understanding how cancers evolve and escape treatment. Although many algorithms have been developed for capturing tumor heterogeneity, they are designed for analyzing either a single type of genomic aberration or individual biopsies. Here we present THEMIS (Tumor Heterogeneity Extensible Modeling via an Integrative System), which allows for the joint analysis of different types of genomic aberrations from multiple biopsies taken from the same patient, using a dynamic graphical model. Simulation experiments demonstrate higher accuracy of THEMIS over its ancestor, TITAN. The heterogeneity analysis results from THEMIS are validated with single cell DNA sequencing from a clinical tumor biopsy. When THEMIS is used to analyze tumor heterogeneity among multiple biopsies from the same patient, it helps to reveal the mutation accumulation history, track cancer progression, and identify the mutations related to treatment resistance. We implement our model via an extensible modeling platform, which makes our approach open, reproducible, and easy for others to extend. Cancer is heterogeneous in the sense that the cancer cells in a tumor are not genetically identical, but form dis-tinct clones, defined as subpopulations of cancer cells that host the same genomic aberrations. In aggressive and metastatic cancers, these genomic aberrations quickly evolve, resulting in extreme spatial and temporal heteroge-neity 1,2 . Therefore, multiple biopsies over different locations and at different time points need to be collected and sequenced in order to capture the complexity of tumor genomic landscapes and provide insight into how tumors evolve and escape treatment 3,4 . Accordingly, computational tools are needed to accurately characterize the clonal structure of cancer and reveal how that structure evolves over time. In recent years, a large number of computational tools and statistical models have been developed to analyze tumor heterogeneity from DNA sequencing data (Table 1). However, most of these tools only model one type of genomic aberration, such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), or structural variants. Restricting the analysis to a single type of mutation not only reduces statistical power to accurately detect the clonal structure within the tumor, but also prevents us from understanding interactions among different types of mutations. Furthermore, many SNV-based methods assume that no copy number changes have occurred, which is extremely improbable. Therefore, their estimation of the prevalence of a given clone can be inaccurate, and the corresponding heterogeneity results may be misleading. Existing methods that capture SNVs and CNAs in the same model (i.e., phyloWGS 5},

Although PAX5 mutation is a critical driver of B-ALL development in mice and humans, it remains unclear how its loss contributes to leukemogenesis and whether ongoing PAX5 deficiency is required for B-ALL maintenance. Here we used transgenic RNAi to reversibly suppress endogenous Pax5 expression in the hematopoietic compartment of mice, which cooperates with activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) to induce B-ALL. In this model, restoring endogenous Pax5 expression in established B-ALL triggers immunophenotypic maturation and durable disease remission by engaging a transcriptional program reminiscent of normal B-cell differentiation. Notably, even brief Pax5 restoration in B-ALL cells causes rapid cell cycle exit and disables their leukemia-initiating capacity. These and similar findings in human B-ALL cell lines establish that Pax5 hypomorphism promotes B-ALL self-renewal by impairing a differentiation program that can be re-engaged despite the presence of additional oncogenic lesions. Our results establish a causal relationship between the hallmark genetic and phenotypic features of B-ALL and suggest that engaging the latent differentiation potential of B-ALL cells may provide new therapeutic entry points.},

  abstract = {Background Early cancer detection could identify tumors at a time when outcomes are superior and treatment is less morbid. This prospective case-control sub-study (from NCT02889978 and NCT03085888) assessed the performance of targeted methylation analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect and localize multiple cancer types across all stages at high specificity. Participants and methods The 6689 participants [2482 cancer ({$>$}50 cancer types), 4207 non-cancer] were divided into training and validation sets. Plasma cfDNA underwent bisulfite sequencing targeting a panel of {$>$}100 000 informative methylation regions. A classifier was developed and validated for cancer detection and tissue of origin (TOO) localization. Results Performance was consistent in training and validation sets. In validation, specificity was 99.3\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 98.3\% to 99.8\%; 0.7\% false-positive rate (FPR)]. Stage I\textendash III sensitivity was 67.3\% (CI: 60.7\% to 73.3\%) in a pre-specified set of 12 cancer types (anus, bladder, colon/rectum, esophagus, head and neck, liver/bile-duct, lung, lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, plasma cell neoplasm, stomach), which account for {$\sim$}63\% of US cancer deaths annually, and was 43.9\% (CI: 39.4\% to 48.5\%) in all cancer types. Detection increased with increasing stage: in the pre-specified cancer types sensitivity was 39\% (CI: 27\% to 52\%) in stage I, 69\% (CI: 56\% to 80\%) in stage II, 83\% (CI: 75\% to 90\%) in stage III, and 92\% (CI: 86\% to 96\%) in stage IV. In all cancer types sensitivity was 18\% (CI: 13\% to 25\%) in stage I, 43\% (CI: 35\% to 51\%) in stage II, 81\% (CI: 73\% to 87\%) in stage III, and 93\% (CI: 87\% to 96\%) in stage IV. TOO was predicted in 96\% of samples with cancer-like signal; of those, the TOO localization was accurate in 93\%. Conclusions cfDNA sequencing leveraging informative methylation patterns detected more than 50 cancer types across stages. Considering the potential value of early detection in deadly malignancies, further evaluation of this test is justified in prospective population-level studies.},

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90\% of all cases of primary liver cancer. The main risk factors for developing HCC are well known and include hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol intake and ingestion of the fungal metabolite aflatoxin B1. Additional risk factors such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are also emerging. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC have led to identification of critical driver mutations; however, the most prevalent of these are not yet druggable targets. The molecular classification of HCC is not established, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification is the main clinical algorithm for the stratification of patients according to prognosis and treatment allocation. Surveillance programmes enable the detection of early-stage tumours that are amenable to curative therapies \textemdash{} resection, liver transplantation or local ablation. At more developed stages, only chemoembolization (for intermediate HCC) and sorafenib (for advanced HCC) have shown survival benefits. There are major unmet needs in HCC management that might be addressed through the discovery of new therapies and their combinations for use in the adjuvant setting and for intermediate- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, biomarkers for therapy stratification, patient-tailored strategies targeting driver mutations and/or activating signalling cascades, and validated measurements of quality of life are needed. Recent failures in the testing of systemic drugs for intermediate and advanced stages have indicated a need to refine trial designs and to define novel approaches.},

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for \textasciitilde 90\% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for HCC development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25\% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced HCC. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of HCC management at all evolutionary stages.},

We identified 11,204 cis and 3,791 trans independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by using linear mixed models to perform genome-wide association analyses. Furthermore, using information on both closely and distantly related individuals, heritability was estimated for all expression traits. Of the set of expressed probes (15,966), 10,580 (66\%) had an estimated narrow-sense heritability (h2) greater than zero with a mean (median) value of 0.192 (0.142). Across these probes, on average the proportion of genetic variance explained by all eQTL (hCOJO2) was 31\% (0.060/0.192), meaning that 69\% is missing, with the sentinel SNP of the largest eQTL explaining 87\% (0.052/0.060) of the variance attributed to all identified cis- and trans-eQTL. For the same set of probes, the genetic variance attributed to genome-wide common (MAF {$>$} 0.01) HapMap 3 SNPs (hg2) accounted for on average 48\% (0.093/0.192) of h2. Taken together, the evidence suggests that approximately half the genetic variance for gene expression is not tagged by common SNPs, and of the variance that is tagged by common SNPs, a large proportion can be attributed to identifiable eQTL of large effect, typically in cis. Finally, we present evidence that, compared with a meta-analysis, using individual-level data results in an increase of approximately 50\% in power to detect eQTL.},

The epigenome of plant cells is plastic, that is, it can change in response to internal or external cues, such as during development or due to environmental~changes, to create a memory of such events. Ongoing advances in technologies to read and write epigenomic patterns with increasing resolution, scale and precision are enabling the extent of plant epigenome variation to be more extensively characterized and functionally interrogated. In this Review, we discuss epigenome dynamics and variation within plants during development and in response to environmental changes, including stress, as well as between plants. We review known or potential functions of such plasticity and emphasize the importance of investigating the causality of epigenomic changes. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies that may underpin future research into plant epigenome plasticity.},

  abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a common aging-associated condition with increased risk of hematologic malignancy. Knowledge of the mechanisms driving evolution from CH to overt malignancy has been hampered by a lack of in vivo models that orthogonally activate mutant alleles. Here, we develop independently regulatable mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) and nucleophosmin 1 (Npm1), observed in human CH and AML, respectively. We find Dnmt3a mutation expands hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSC/MPPs), modeling CH. Induction of mutant Npm1 after development of Dnmt3a-mutant CH causes progression to myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), and more aggressive MPD is observed with longer latency between mutations. MPDs uniformly progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following transplant, accompanied by a decrease in HSC/MPPs and an increase in myeloid-restricted progenitors, the latter of which propagate AML in tertiary recipient mice. At a molecular level, progression of CH to MPD is accompanied by selection for mutations activating Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling. Progression to AML is characterized by additional oncogenic signaling mutations (Ptpn11, Pik3r1, Flt3) and/or mutations in epigenetic regulators (Hdac1, Idh1, Arid1a). Together, our study demonstrates that Npm1 mutation drives evolution of Dnmt3a-mutant CH to AML and rate of disease progression is accelerated with longer latency of CH.},

Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric {$\alpha$}-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the {$\beta$}-defensin gene~cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric {$\alpha$}-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order {$\alpha$}-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order {$\alpha$}-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric {$\alpha$}-satellites.

The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either hyper- or hypo-methylated but are rarely found in intermediate methylation states. We develop a model for spatially-dependent collaboration between CpGs, where methylated CpGs recruit methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce the effects of CpG clustering on methylation and produces stable and heritable alternative methylation states of CpG clusters, thus providing a coherent model for methylation inheritance and methylation patterning.},

  abstract = {Many normal tissues undergo age-related drift in DNA methylation, providing a quantitative measure of tissue age. Here, we identify and validate 781 CpG islands (CGI) that undergo significant methylomic drift in 232 normal colorectal tissues and show that these CGI continue to drift in neoplasia while retaining significant correlations across samples. However, compared with normal colon, this drift advanced ({$\sim$}3\textendash 4-fold) faster in neoplasia, consistent with increased cell proliferation during neoplastic progression. The observed drift patterns were broadly consistent with modeled adenoma-to-carcinoma sojourn time distributions from colorectal cancer incidence data. These results support the hypothesis that, beginning with the founder premalignant cell, cancer precursors frequently sojourn for decades before turning into cancer, implying that the founder cell typically arises early in life. At least 77\% to 89\% of the observed drift variance in distal and rectal tumors was explained by stochastic variability associated with neoplastic progression, whereas only 55\% of the variance was explained for proximal tumors. However, gene\textendash CGI pairs in the proximal colon that underwent drift were significantly and primarily negatively correlated with cancer gene expression, suggesting that methylomic drift participates in the clonal evolution of colorectal cancer. Methylomic drift advanced in colorectal neoplasia, consistent with extended sojourn time distributions, which accounts for a significant fraction of epigenetic heterogeneity in colorectal cancer. Importantly, these estimated long-duration premalignant sojourn times suggest that early dietary and lifestyle interventions may be more effective than later changes in reducing colorectal cancer incidence. Significance: These findings present age-related methylomic drift in colorectal neoplasia as evidence that premalignant cells can persist for decades before becoming cancerous.See related commentary by Sapienza, p. 437},

Here, we report that the DNMT3A mutational hotspot at Arg882 (DNMT3AR882H) cooperates with NRAS mutation to transform hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induce acute leukemia development. Mechanistically, DNMT3AR882H directly binds to and potentiates transactivation of stemness genes critical for leukemogenicity including Meis1, Mn1, and Hoxa gene cluster. DNMT3AR882H induces focal epigenetic alterations, including CpG hypomethylation and concurrent gain of active histone modifications, at cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers to facilitate gene transcription. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of a putative Meis1 enhancer carrying DNMT3AR882H-induced DNA hypomethylation impairs Meis1 expression. Importantly, DNMT3AR882H-induced gene-expression programs can be repressed through Dot1l inhibition, providing an attractive therapeutic strategy for DNMT3A-mutated leukemias.},

Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named beachmat, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of beachmat for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.},

This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.},

Nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor alpha (ER{$\alpha$}) and androgen receptors (ARs), are central in this process as they can directly impact gene expression through interaction with the chromatin and subsequent association with coregulators and the transcriptional machinery. Unbiased genome-wide investigations have demonstrated the predominant recruitment of both ER{$\alpha$} and AR to distant (non-promoter)-regulatory elements. Furthermore, these studies revealed a clear relationship between sites of transcription factor recruitment and gene regulation. Indeed, expression profiles from AR-positive primary prostate tumors and cell lines directly relate to the AR cistrome in prostate cancer cells, while the ER{$\alpha$} cistrome in breast cancer cells relates to expression profiles from ER{$\alpha$}-positive primary breast tumors. Additionally, cell-type-specific ER{$\alpha$} cistromes are linked to lineage-specific estrogen-induced expression profiles in different cell types, for example osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells. The pioneer factor forkhead box A1 (FoxA1/HNF3{$\alpha$}) plays a central role in AR and ER{$\alpha$} signaling. It is recruited in a lineage-specific manner translating the epigenetic signature consisting of mono- and dimethylated histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me1/me2) into functional regulatory elements. Hence, through the interplay between the pioneer factor, namely FoxA1, and epigenetic events, the transcriptional potential of a given cell lineage is predefined. Since this directly impacts signaling through nuclear receptors, these discoveries should significantly impact the development of novel therapeutic strategies directed against multiple types of cancer.},

This is true for both FoxA1-dependent and independent enhancers. In contrast, a subset of E2-suppressed genes are controlled by FoxA1-independent ER{$\alpha$} binding sites. Nonetheless, these are sites of E2-induced CARM1 activity. In addition, the MCF7 RNA polymerase II cistrome reveals preferential occupancy of E2-regulated promoters prior to stimulation. Interestingly, E2-suppressed genes tend to lie in otherwise silent genomic regions.

Through genome-wide positional analyses, we demonstrate that FoxA1 cell type-specific functions rely primarily on differential recruitment to chromatin predominantly at distant enhancers rather than proximal promoters. This differential recruitment leads to cell type-specific changes in chromatin structure and functional collaboration with lineage-specific transcription factors. Despite the ability of FoxA1 to bind nucleosomes, its differential binding to chromatin sites is dependent on the distribution of histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation. Together, our results suggest that methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 is part of the epigenetic signature that defines lineage-specific FoxA1 recruitment sites in chromatin. FoxA1 translates this epigenetic signature into changes in chromatin structure thereby establishing lineage-specific transcriptional enhancers and programs.},

  abstract = {Estrogen receptor {$\alpha$} (ER{$\alpha$}) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy; however, resistance is common in ER{$\alpha$}-positive tumors that overexpress the growth factor receptor ERBB2. Even in the absence of estrogen, ER{$\alpha$} can be activated by growth factors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen; however, the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown. Here we show that the EGF-induced ER{$\alpha$} genomic targets, its cistromes, are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1. The EGF-induced ER{$\alpha$} cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers. This provides a potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ER{$\alpha$}-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2. These results suggest a central role for ER{$\alpha$} in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ER{$\alpha$}, as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone.},

  abstract = {The human genome can be segmented into topologically associating domains (TADs), which have been proposed to spatially sequester genes and regulatory elements through chromatin looping. Interactions between TADs have also been suggested, presumably because of variable boundary positions across individual cells. However, the nature, extent and consequence of these dynamic boundaries remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution imaging with Oligopaint technology to quantify the interaction frequencies across both weak and strong boundaries. We find that chromatin intermingling across population-defined boundaries is widespread but that the extent of permissibility is locus-specific. Cohesin depletion, which abolishes domain formation at the population level, does not induce ectopic interactions but instead reduces interactions across all boundaries tested. In contrast, WAPL or CTCF depletion increases inter-domain contacts in a cohesin-dependent manner. Reduced chromatin intermingling due to cohesin loss affects the topology and transcriptional bursting frequencies of genes near boundaries. We propose that cohesin occasionally bypasses boundaries to promote incorporation of boundary-proximal genes into neighboring domains.},

This process is thought to be regulated by the heat shock factor HSF1, which controls the release of RNAPII from promoter-proximal pausing. Here, we analyze the events taking place in hESCs upstream of RNAPII release. We find that temperature stress results in the activation or decommissioning of thousands of enhancers. This process involves alterations in the occupancy of transcription factors HSF1, AP-1, NANOG, KLF4, and OCT4 accompanied by nucleosome remodeling by BRG1 and changes in H3K27ac. Furthermore, redistribution of RAD21 and CTCF results in the formation and disassembly of interactions mediated by these two proteins. These alterations tether and untether enhancers to their cognate promoters or refashion insulated neighborhoods, thus transforming the landscape of enhancer-promoter interactions. Details of the 3D interactome remodeling process support loop extrusion initiating at random sites as a mechanism for the establishment of CTCF/cohesin loops.},

However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a temporal understanding of the regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here, we developed SHARE-seq, a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression within the same single cell. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify             cis-             regulatory interactions and define Domains of Regulatory Chromatin (DORCs), which significantly overlap with super-enhancers. We show that during lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We therefore develop a computational strategy (chromatin potential) to quantify chromatin lineage-priming and predict cell fate outcomes. Together, SHARE-seq provides an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells within tissues.},

Here, we mapped active chromatin landscapes with gene expression, whole exomes, copy number profiles, and DNA methylomes across 44 patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), 50 primary tumors, and 10 neural stem cells (NSCs) to identify essential super-enhancer (SE)\textendash associated genes and the core transcription factors that establish SEs and maintain GSC identity. GSCs segregate into two groups dominated by distinct enhancer profiles and unique developmental core transcription factor regulatory programs. Group-specific transcription factors enforce GSC identity; they exhibit higher activity in glioblastomas versus NSCs, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, and are required for glioblastoma growth in vivo. Although transcription factors are commonly considered undruggable, group-specific enhancer regulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway predicts sensitivity to MEK inhibition. These data demonstrate that transcriptional identity can be leveraged to identify novel dependencies and therapeutic approaches.},

We explored the effect of varying levels of methylation on event-free survival (EFS).ResultsThe mean methylation level was 25 \% in de novo ALL and significantly higher than the control group 2 \%, P {$<$} 0.01). Forty-two percent of cases (39/93) had hypermethylation (level over 10 \%). Fifty-seven percent (12/21) and 38 \% (27/72) T- and precursor-B ALL patients had hypermethylation (not significant). For all patients, the 8-year EFS was (83 {$\pm$} 4) \%, standard risk (91 {$\pm$} 4) \%, intermediate risk (IR) (82 {$\pm$} 5) \%, and high risk (HR) (43 {$\pm$} 19) \% ({$\chi$} 2 = 11.58, P {$<$} 0.01). Hypermethylation was associated with a lower 8-year EFS (71 {$\pm$} 7 vs. 91 {$\pm$} 4 \%, P = 0.02) in univariate analyses.Conclusions Children with ALL have higher levels of p15 CpG island methylation than a control group of children with ITP. Among children with ALL, hypermethylation was associated with inferior EFS. Higher levels of p15 CpG island methylation may be a poor prognostic marker in childhood ALL.},

The effects of unwanted variation have been extensively documented in gene expression array studies and numerous methods have been developed to mitigate these effects. However, there has been much less re-search focused on the appropriate methodology to use for accounting for unwanted variation in methy-lation array studies.

  abstract = {Available computational methods for tumor phylogeny inference via single-cell sequencing (SCS) data typically aim to identify the most likely perfect phylogeny tree satisfying the infinite sites assumption (ISA). However, the limitations of SCS technologies including frequent allele dropout and variable sequence coverage may prohibit a perfect phylogeny. In addition, ISA violations are commonly observed in tumor phylogenies due to the loss of heterozygosity, deletions, and convergent evolution. In order to address such limitations, we introduce the optimal subperfect phylogeny problem which asks to integrate SCS data with matching bulk sequencing data by minimizing a linear combination of potential false negatives (due to allele dropout or variance in sequence coverage), false positives (due to read errors) among mutation calls, and the number of mutations that violate ISA (real or because of incorrect copy number estimation). We then describe a combinatorial formulation to solve this problem which ensures that several lineage constraints imposed by the use of variant allele frequencies (VAFs, derived from bulk sequence data) are satisfied. We express our formulation both in the form of an integer linear program (ILP) and\textemdash as a first in tumor phylogeny reconstruction\textemdash a Boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and solve them by leveraging state-of-the-art ILP/CSP solvers. The resulting method, which we name PhISCS, is the first to integrate SCS and bulk sequencing data while accounting for ISA violating mutations. In contrast to the alternative methods, typically based on probabilistic approaches, PhISCS provides a guarantee of optimality in reported solutions. Using simulated and real data sets, we demonstrate that PhISCS is more general and accurate than all available approaches.},

Currently, fluorescent in-situ hybridization probes are employed to detect candidate translocations in bone marrow samples from B-ALL patients. Recently Hi-C, a sequencing-based technique originally designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of the nuclear genome, was shown to effectively recognize structural variants. Here, we demonstrate that Hi-C can be used as a genome-wide assay to detect translocations and other structural variants of potential clinical interest. Structural variants were identified in both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples, including an ETV6-RUNX1 translocation present in one pediatric B-ALL patient. Our report provides proof-of-principle that Hi-C could be an effective strategy to globally detect driver structural variants in B-ALL peripheral blood specimens, reducing the need for invasive bone marrow biopsies and candidate-based clinical tests.},

Genetically engineered mouse models reveal that ERG overexpression alone is not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, but combined loss of PTEN results in an aggressive invasive phenotype. Here, we show that oncogenic ERG repressed PI3K signaling through direct transcriptional suppression of IRS2, leading to reduced RTK levels and activity. In accordance with this finding, ERG-positive human prostate cancers had a repressed AKT gene signature and transcriptional downregulation of IRS2. Although overexpression of IRS2 activated PI3K signaling, promoting cell migration in a PI3K-dependent manner, this did not fully recapitulate the phenotype seen with loss of PTEN as PI3K signaling is not as robust as observed in the setting of loss of PTEN. Importantly, deletions of the PTEN locus, which promotes active PI3K signaling, were among the most significant copy-number alterations that co-occurred with ERG genomic rearrangements. This work provides insight on how initiating oncogenic events may directly influence the selection of secondary concomitant alterations to promote oncogenic signaling during tumor evolution. Significance: This work provides insight on how initiating oncogenic events may directly influence the selection of secondary concomitant alterations to promote tumorigenesis.},

The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is widely used to quantify DNA methylation; nevertheless, the design of an appropriate analysis pipeline faces severe challenges due to the convolution of biological and technical variability and the presence of a signal bias between Infinium I and II probe design types. Despite recent attempts to investigate how to analyze DNA methylation data with such an array design, it has not been possible to perform a comprehensive comparison between different bioinformatics pipelines due to the lack of appropriate data sets having both large sample size and sufficient number of technical replicates. Here we perform such a comparative analysis, targeting the problems of reducing the technical variability, eliminating the probe design bias and reducing the batch effect by exploiting two unpublished data sets, which included technical replicates and were profiled for DNA methylation either on peripheral blood, monocytes or muscle biopsies. We evaluated the performance of different analysis pipelines and demonstrated that: (1) it is critical to correct for the probe design type, since the amplitude of the measured methylation change depends on the underlying chemistry; (2) the effect of different normalization schemes is mixed, and the most effective method in our hands were quantile normalization and Beta Mixture Quantile dilation (BMIQ); (3) it is beneficial to correct for batch effects. In conclusion, our comparative analysis using a comprehensive data set suggests an efficient pipeline for proper identification of differentially methylated CpGs using the Illumina 450K arrays.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims There are few validated biomarkers that can be used to predict outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer. Part of the challenge is the genetic and molecular heterogeneity of colorectal tumors not only among patients, but also within tumors. We have explored intratumor heterogeneity at the epigenetic level, due to its dynamic nature. We analyzed DNA methylation profiles of the digestive tract surface and the central bulk and invasive front regions of colorectal tumors. Methods We determined the DNA methylation profiles of {$>$}450,000 CpG sites in 3 macrodissected regions of 79 colorectal tumors and 23 associated liver metastases, obtained from 2 hospitals in Spain. We also analyzed samples for KRAS and BRAF mutations, 499,170 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed immunohistochemical analyses. Results We observed differences in DNA methylation among the 3 tumor sections; regions of tumor-host interface differed the most from the other tumor sections. Interestingly, tumor samples collected from areas closer to the gastrointestinal transit most frequently shared methylation events with metastases. When we calculated individual coefficients to quantify heterogeneity, we found that epigenetic homogeneity was significantly associated with short time of relapse-free survival (log-rank P~=.037) and short time of overall survival (log-rank P~=.026) in patients with locoregional colorectal cancer. Conclusions In an analysis of 79 colorectal tumors, we found significant heterogeneity in patterns of DNA methylation within each tumor; the level of heterogeneity correlates with times of relapse-free and overall survival.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma is a rapidly evolving high-grade astrocytoma that is distinguished pathologically from lower grade gliomas by the presence of necrosis and microvascular hyperplasia. Necrotic areas are typically surrounded by hypercellular regions known as "pseudopalisades" originated by local tumor vessel occlusions that induce collective cellular migration events. This leads to the formation of waves of tumor cells actively migrating away from central hypoxia. We present a mathematical model that incorporates the interplay among two tumor cell phenotypes, a necrotic core and the oxygen distribution. Our simulations reveal the formation of a traveling wave of tumor cells that reproduces the observed histologic patterns of pseudopalisades. Additional simulations of the model equations show that preventing the collapse of tumor microvessels leads to slower glioma invasion, a fact that might be exploited for therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal in cancer research is to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation. This is key to developing more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches. One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the 1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily. Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the Integrative OncoGenomics(IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000 tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer.},

Yet, at the time of clinical diagnosis, the majority of human tumors display startling heterogeneity in many morphological and physiological features, such as expression of cell surface receptors, proliferative and angiogenic potential. To a substantial extent, this heterogeneity might be attributed to morphological and epigenetic plasticity, but there is also strong evidence for the co-existence of genetically divergent tumor cell clones within tumors. In this perspective, we summarize the sources of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity with emphasis on genetic heterogeneity. We review experimental evidence for the existence of both intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity as well as frequent evolutionary divergence between primary tumors and metastatic outgrowths. Furthermore, we discuss potential biological and clinical implications of intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Unique features of these neuroendocrine tumours are the early age of onset, the high frequency of metastatic disease at diagnosis and the tendency for spontaneous regression of tumours in infancy. The most malignant tumours have amplification of the MYCN oncogene (encoding a transcription factor), which is usually associated with poor survival, even in localized disease. Although transgenic mouse models have shown that MYCN overexpression can be a tumour-initiating factor, many other cooperating genes and tumour suppressor genes are still under investigation and might also have a role in tumour development. Segmental chromosome alterations are frequent in neuroblastoma and are associated with worse outcome. The rare familial neuroblastomas are usually associated with germline mutations in ALK, which is mutated in 10\textendash 15\% of primary tumours, and provides a potential therapeutic target. Risk-stratified therapy has facilitated the reduction of therapy for children with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease. Advances in therapy for patients with high-risk disease include intensive induction chemotherapy and myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by the treatment of minimal residual disease using differentiation therapy and immunotherapy; these have improved 5-year overall survival to 50\%. Currently, new approaches targeting the noradrenaline transporter, genetic pathways and the tumour microenvironment hold promise for further improvements in survival and long-term quality of life.},

Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {Although it is known that the methylation of DNA in 5' promoters suppresses gene expression, the role of DNA methylation in gene bodies is unclear. In mammals, tissue- and cell type-specific methylation is present in a small percentage of 5' CpG island (CGI) promoters, whereas a far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies, coinciding with highly conserved sequences. Tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce, or, paradoxically, enhance transcription elongation efficiency. Capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) experiments also indicate that transcription commonly initiates within and between genes. To investigate the role of intragenic methylation, we generated a map of DNA methylation from the human brain encompassing 24.7 million of the 28 million CpG sites. From the dense, high-resolution coverage of CpG islands, the majority of methylated CpG islands were shown to be in intragenic and intergenic regions, whereas less than 3\% of CpG islands in 5' promoters were methylated. The CpG islands in all three locations overlapped with RNA markers of transcription initiation, and unmethylated CpG islands also overlapped significantly with trimethylation of H3K4, a histone modification enriched at promoters. The general and CpG-island-specific patterns of methylation are conserved in mouse tissues. An in-depth investigation of the human SHANK3 locus and its mouse homologue demonstrated that this tissue-specific DNA methylation regulates intragenic promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. These methylation-regulated, alternative transcripts are expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner, and are expressed differentially within a single cell type from distinct brain regions. These results support a major role for intragenic methylation in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies.},

Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs), and that inhibition of DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased histone acetylation and aberrant ASE-skipping events. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leads to exon skipping that shows a highly significant degree of overlap with that caused by MeCP2 knockdown. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative RNA splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through the subsequent recruitment of HDACs.},

  abstract = {The average individual is expected to harbor thousands of variants within non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation. However, it is currently not possible to interpret reliably the functional consequences of genetic variation within any given transcription factor recognition sequence. To address this, we comprehensively analyzed heritable genome-wide binding patterns of a major sequence-specific regulator (CTCF) in relation to genetic variability in binding site sequences across a multi-generational pedigree. We localized and quantified CTCF occupancy by ChIP-seq in 12 related and unrelated individuals spanning three generations, followed by comprehensive targeted resequencing of the entire CTCF-binding landscape across all individuals. We identified hundreds of variants with reproducible quantitative effects on CTCF occupancy (both positive and negative). While these effects paralleled protein-DNA recognition energetics when averaged, they were extensively buffered by striking local context dependencies. In the significant majority of cases buffering was complete, resulting in silent variants spanning every position within the DNA recognition interface irrespective of level of binding energy or evolutionary constraint. The prevalence of complex partial or complete buffering effects severely constrained the ability to predict reliably the impact of variation within any given binding site instance. Surprisingly, 40\% of variants that increased CTCF occupancy occurred at positions of human-chimp divergence, challenging the expectation that the vast majority of functional regulatory variants should be deleterious. Our results suggest that, even in the presence of "perfect" genetic information afforded by resequencing and parallel studies in multiple related individuals, genomic site-specific prediction of the consequences of individual variation in regulatory DNA will require systematic coupling with empirical functional genomic measurements.},

Here, we show that mutant cohesin proteins block differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in~vitro and in~vivo and enforce stem cell programs. These effects are restricted to immature HSPC populations, where cohesin mutants show increased chromatin accessibility and likelihood of transcription factor binding site occupancy by HSPC regulators including ERG, GATA2, and RUNX1, as measured by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. Epistasis experiments show that silencing these transcription factors rescues the differentiation block caused by cohesin mutants. Together, these results show that mutant cohesins impair HSPC differentiation by controlling chromatin accessibility and transcription factor activity, possibly contributing to leukemic disease.},

In particular, the stationary frequencies of traits in the population are independent of its size, spatial structure, and evolutionary update rule, and these frequencies can be calculated by evaluating a simple stochastic process describing a population of size one (i.e. the mutation process itself). We conclude by analyzing mixing times, which characterize rates of convergence of the mutation process along the lineages, in terms of demographic variables of the evolutionary process.},

Now, three studies examine the extent to which genetic variation affects the chromatin of individuals with diverse ancestry and genetic variation (see the Perspective by Furey and Sethupathy). Kasowski et al. (p. 750, published online 17 October) examined how genetic variation affects differences in chromatin states and their correlation to histone modifications, as well as more general DNA binding factors. Kilpinen et al. (p. 744, published online 17 October) document how genetic variation is linked to allelic specificity in transcription factor binding, histone modifications, and transcription. McVicker et al. (p. 747, published online 17 October) identified how quantitative trait loci affect histone modifications in Yoruban individuals and established which specific transcription factors affect such modifications. Histone modifications are important markers of function and chromatin state, yet the DNA sequence elements that direct them to specific genomic locations are poorly understood. Here, we identify hundreds of quantitative trait loci, genome-wide, that affect histone modification or RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy in Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). In many cases, the same variant is associated with quantitative changes in multiple histone marks and Pol II, as well as in deoxyribonuclease I sensitivity and nucleosome positioning. Transcription factor binding site polymorphisms are correlated overall with differences in local histone modification, and we identify specific transcription factors whose binding leads to histone modification in LCLs. Furthermore, variants that affect chromatin at distal regulatory sites frequently also direct changes in chromatin and gene expression at associated promoters. Human genetic variation affects transcription factor binding, leading to histone modifications. [Also see Perspective by Furey and Sethupathy] Human genetic variation affects transcription factor binding, leading to histone modifications. [Also see Perspective by Furey and Sethupathy]},

  abstract = {The recent proliferation of next generation sequencing with short reads has enabled many new experimental opportunities but, at the same time, has raised formidable computational challenges in genome assembly. One of the key advances that has led to an improvement in contig lengths has been mate pairs, which facilitate the assembly of repeating regions. Mate pairs have been algorithmically incorporated into most next generation assemblers as various heuristic post-processing steps to correct the assembly graph or to link contigs into scaffolds. Such methods have allowed the identification of longer contigs than would be possible with single reads; however, they can still fail to resolve complex repeats. Thus, improved methods for incorporating mate pairs will have a strong effect on contig length in the future. Here, we introduce the paired de Bruijn graph, a generalization of the de Bruijn graph that incorporates mate pair information into the graph structure itself instead of analyzing mate pairs at a post-processing step. This graph has the potential to be used in place of the de Bruijn graph in any de Bruijn graph based assembler, maintaining all other assembly steps such as error-correction and repeat resolution. Through assembly results on simulated perfect data, we argue that this can effectively improve the contig sizes in assembly.},

Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

We constructed RRBS libraries from murine ES cells and from ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 RRBS clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of {$>$}99.9\%. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in CpG and 3 in CpT dinucleotides. Non-CpG methylation was {$>$}250-fold reduced compared with wild-type ES cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in CpA and CpT methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells.

  abstract = {Understanding the thermodynamic function of life may shed light on its origin. Life, as are all irreversible processes, is contingent on entropy production. Entropy production is a measure of the rate of the tendency of Nature to explore available microstates. The most important irreversible process generating entropy in the biosphere, and thus facilitating this exploration, is the absorption and transformation of sunlight into heat. Here we hypothesize that life began, and persists today, as a catalyst for the absorption and dissipation of sunlight at the surface of shallow seas. The resulting heat is then efficiently harvested by other irreversible processes such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents. RNA and DNA are the most efficient of all known molecules for absorbing the intense ultraviolet light that could have penetrated the dense early atmosphere, and are remarkably rapid in transforming this light into heat in the presence of liquid water. From this perspective, the origin and evolution of life, inseparable from water and the water cycle, can be understood as resulting from the natural thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of the Earth in its interaction with its solar environment. A mechanism is proposed for the reproduction of RNA and DNA without the need for enzymes, promoted instead through UV light dissipation and the ambient conditions of prebiotic Earth.},

These genes encode proteins that function in growth regulatory and differentiation pathways. Mutations in those genes increase the net reproductive rate of cells. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a feature of most human cancers. Mutations in CIN genes increase the rate at which whole chromosomes or large parts of chromosomes are lost or gained during cell division. CIN causes an imbalance in chromosome number (aneuploidy) and an enhanced rate of loss of heterozygosity, which is an important mechanism of inactivating tumor suppressor genes. A crucial question of cancer biology is whether CIN is an early event and thus a driving force of tumorigenesis. Here we discuss mathematical models of situations where inactivation of one or two tumor suppressor genes is required for tumorigenesis. If two tumor suppressor genes have to be inactivated in rate-limiting steps, then CIN is likely to emerge before the inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene.},

Cancer arises when a single cellular lineage receives multiple mutations. \textbullet{} Epithelial tissues are subdivided into compartments, and cancer initiation occurs in compartments. Within each compartment, there is a continuous turnover of cells. Each compartment is replenished by division and differentiation of a small number of stem cells. In a healthy tissue, homeostatic mechanisms maintain constant cell numbers. \textbullet{} Mathematical models describe the process of cancer initiation and progression and provide a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of tumorigenesis with respect to mutation, selection, genetic instability and tissue architecture. \textbullet{} Mutations that activate oncogenes can confer a selective advantage to the cell. We calculate the time until a cellular lineage with an activated oncogene arises and takes over a population of cells. \textbullet{} Inactivating both alleles of a TSG also leads to a selective advantage to the cell. The dynamics of TSG inactivation are described by three kinetic laws that depend on the size of the cellular population and the mutation rates. In small, intermediate and large populations, a TSG is inactivated, respectively, by two, one and zero rate-limiting hits. \textbullet{} Chromosomal instability (CIN) accelerates the rate of TSG inactivation. \textbullet{} It takes two rate-limiting hits to inactivate a TSG in a small population of cells with or without CIN. Therefore, CIN mutations can occur early in tumorigenesis. \textbullet{} Knudson's two-hit hypothesis is compatible with the idea that one mutation occurs in the first allele of the TSG and one mutation occurs in a CIN gene. The mutation inactivating the second TSG allele is not rate-limiting in a CIN cell. \textbullet{} Because of the tremendous acceleration of loss of heterozygosity in CIN cells, it is very likely that most cancers, which require inactivation of at least two TSGs in rate-limiting scenarios, are initiated by CIN mutations, even if CIN has a severe cost in terms of somatic fitness.},

Several additional genetic hits in other tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes drive the progression from polyps to malignant, invasive cancer. The majority of colorectal cancers present chromosomal instability, CIN, which is caused by mutations in genes that are required to maintain chromosomal stability. A major question in cancer genetics is whether CIN is an early event and thus a driving force of tumor progression. We present a new mathematical model of colon cancer initiation assuming a linear flow from stem cells to differentiated cells to apoptosis. We study the consequences of mutations in different cell types and calculate the conditions for CIN to precede APC inactivation.

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms, cells cooperate within a well-defined developmental program. Cancer is a breakdown of such cooperation: cells mutate to phenotypes of uncoordinated proliferation. We study basic principles of the architecture of solid tissues that influence the rate of cancer initiation. In particular, we explore how somatic selection acts to prevent or to promote cancer. Cells with mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes often have increased proliferation rates. Somatic selection increases their abundance and thus enhances the risk of cancer. Many potentially harmful mutations, however, increase the probability of triggering apoptosis and, hence, initially lead to cells with reduced net proliferation rates. Such cells are eliminated by somatic selection, which therefore also works to reduce the risk of cancer. We show that a tissue organization into small compartments avoids the rapid spread of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, but promotes genetic instability. In small compartments, genetic instability, which confers a selective disadvantage for the cell, can spread by random drift. If both deleterious and advantageous mutations participate in tumor initiation, then we find an intermediate optimum for the compartment size.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}After nearly two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no one chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist. The remaining gaps include ribosomal rDNA arrays, large near-identical segmental duplications, and satellite DNA arrays. These regions harbor largely unexplored variation of unknown consequence, and their absence from the current reference genome can lead to experimental artifacts and hide true variants when re-sequencing additional human genomes. Here we present a de novo human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38, along with the first gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome, we reconstructed the \textasciitilde 2.8 megabase centromeric satellite DNA array and closed all 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequence from the human pseudoautosomal regions and cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). This complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, also allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays for the first time. These results demonstrate that finishing the human genome is now within reach and will enable ongoing efforts to complete the remaining human chromosomes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The spatial organization of chromosomes has long been connected to their polymeric nature and is believed to be important for their biological functions, including the control of interactions between genomic elements, the maintenance of genetic information, and the compaction and safe transfer of chromosomes to cellular progeny. chromosome conformation capture techniques, particularly Hi-C, have provided a comprehensive picture of spatial chromosome organization and revealed new features and elements of chromosome folding. Furthermore, recent advances in microscopy have made it possible to obtain distance maps for extensive regions of chromosomes (Bintu et al., 2018; Nir et al., 2018 [2\textbullet\textbullet,3]), providing information complementary to, and in excellent agreement with, Hi-C maps. Not only has the resolution of both techniques advanced significantly, but new perturbation data generated in the last two years have led to the identification of molecular mechanisms behind large-scale genome organization. Two major mechanisms that have been proposed to govern chromosome organization are (i) the active (ATP-dependent) process of loop extrusion by Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, and (ii) the spatial compartmentalization of the genome, which is likely mediated by affinity interactions between heterochromatic regions (Falk et al., 2019 [76\textbullet\textbullet ]) rather than by ATP-dependent processes. Here, we review existing evidence that these two processes operate together to fold chromosomes in interphase and that loop extrusion alone drives mitotic compaction. We discuss possible implications of these mechanisms for chromosome function.},

Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)1,2 analysis has revealed a complex genomic landscape of internal chromosomal structures in vertebrate cells3\textendash 7, but the identical sequence of sister chromatids has made it difficult to determine how they topologically interact in replicated chromosomes. Here we describe sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C (scsHi-C), which is based on labelling of nascent DNA with 4-thio-thymidine and nucleoside conversion chemistry. Genome-wide conformation maps of human chromosomes reveal that sister-chromatid pairs interact most frequently at the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs). Continuous loading of a dynamic cohesin pool separates sister-chromatid pairs inside TADs and is required to focus sister-chromatid contacts at TAD boundaries. We identified a subset of TADs that are overall highly paired and are characterized by facultative heterochromatin and insulated topological domains that form separately within individual sister chromatids. The rich pattern of sister-chromatid topologies and our scsHi-C technology will make it possible to investigate how physical interactions between identical DNA molecules contribute to DNA repair, gene expression, chromosome segregation, and potentially other biological processes.},

Hence the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine, or the methylome, has been attracting intense attention. In recent years, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has enabled methylome analysis at single-base resolution. However, WGBS typically requires microgram quantities of DNA as well as global PCR amplification, thereby precluding its application to samples of limited amounts. This is presumably because bisulfite treatment of adaptor-tagged templates, which is inherent to current WGBS methods, leads to substantial DNA fragmentation. To circumvent the bisulfite-induced loss of intact sequencing templates, we conceived an alternative method termed Post-Bisulfite Adaptor Tagging (PBAT) wherein bisulfite treatment precedes adaptor tagging by two rounds of random primer extension. The PBAT method can generate a substantial number of unamplified reads from as little as subnanogram quantities of DNA. It requires only 100 ng of DNA for amplification-free WGBS of mammalian genomes. Thus, the PBAT method will enable various novel applications that would not otherwise be possible, thereby contributing to the rapidly growing field of epigenomics.},

  abstract = {Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to BCL11B. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele and association of BCL11B with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. Significance: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of BCL11B driven by diverse structural alterations, including de novo superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic boundaries.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659},

We develop a mathematical model that reproduces the strand bias and use this model to make two predictions. First, the variation in strand bias should decrease when 5hmC turnover increases. Second, the strand bias of two sister cells should be strongly anti-correlated. We validate these predictions experimentally, and use our model to reconstruct lineages of two- and four-cell mouse embryos, showing that single-cell 5hmC sequencing can be used as a lineage reconstruction tool.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic modifications have effects on phenotype, but they are generally considered to be cleared on passage through the germ line in mammals, so that only genetic traits are inherited. Here we describe the inheritance of an epigenetic modification at the agouti locus in mice. In viable yellow ( Avy/a) mice, transcription originating in an intra-cisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon inserted upstream of the agouti gene ( A) causes ectopic expression of agouti protein, resulting in yellow fur, obesity, diabetes and increased susceptibility to tumours1. The pleiotropic effects of ectopic agouti expression are presumably due to effects of the paracrine signal on other tissues. Avy mice display variable expressivity because they are epigenetic mosaics for activity of the retrotransposon: isogenic Avy mice have coats that vary in a continuous spectrum from full yellow, through variegated yellow/agouti, to full agouti (pseudoagouti). The distribution of phenotypes among offspring is related to the phenotype of the dam; when an A vy dam has the agouti phenotype, her offspring are more likely to be agouti2,3. We demonstrate here that this maternal epigenetic effect is not the result of a maternally contributed environment. Rather, our data show that it results from incomplete erasure of an epigenetic modification when a silenced Avy allele is passed through the female germ line, with consequent inheritance of the epigenetic modification. Because retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes, this type of inheritance may be common.},

The system attains demethylation efficiencies {$>$}50\% in seven out of nine loci tested. Four of these seven loci showed demethylation of {$>$}90\%.

The clinical implications of ITH remain poorly defined. Data are limited with respect to whether ITH is an independent determinant of patient survival outcomes, across different cancer types. Here, we report the results of a pan-cancer analysis of over 3300 tumors, showing a varied landscape of ITH across 9 cancer types. While some gene mutations are subclonal, the majority of driver gene mutations are clonal events, present in nearly all cancer cells. Strikingly, high levels of ITH are associated with poorer survival across diverse types of cancer. The adverse impact of high ITH is independent of other clinical, pathologic and molecular factors. High ITH tends to be associated with lower levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, but this association is not able to explain the observed survival differences. Together, these data show that ITH is a prognostic marker in multiple cancers. These results illuminate the natural history of cancer evolution, indicating that tumor heterogeneity represents a significant obstacle to cancer control.},

Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio\,=\,8.1, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,5.7, 11.5).

  abstract = {Recent advances in long-range Hi-C contact mapping have revealed the importance of the 3D structure of chromosomes in gene expression. A current challenge is to identify the key molecular drivers of this 3D structure. Several genomic features, such as architectural proteins and functional elements, were shown to be enriched at topological domain borders using classical enrichment tests. Here we propose multiple logistic regression to identify those genomic features that positively or negatively influence domain border establishment or maintenance. The model is flexible, and can account for statistical interactions among multiple genomic features. Using both simulated and real data, we show that our model outperforms enrichment test and non-parametric models, such as random forests, for the identification of genomic features that influence domain borders. Using Drosophila Hi-C data at a very high resolution of 1 kb, our model suggests that, among architectural proteins, BEAF-32 and CP190 are the main positive drivers of 3D domain borders. In humans, our model identifies well-known architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin, as well as ZNF143 and Polycomb group proteins as positive drivers of domain borders. The model also reveals the existence of several negative drivers that counteract the presence of domain borders including P300, RXRA, BCL11A and ELK1.},

  abstract = {The relationship between noncoding DNA sequence and gene expression is not well-understood. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present SNPpet, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained SNPpet on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of {$\sim$}500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. SNPpet's predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman {$\rho$} = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of SNPpet to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.},

The two histological subtypes, adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) and papillary craniopharyngioma (PCP), differ in genesis and age distribution. ACPs are diagnosed with a bimodal peak of incidence (5\textendash 15 years and 45\textendash 60 years), whereas PCPs are restricted to adults mainly in the fifth and sixth decades of life. ACPs are driven by somatic mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding {$\beta$}-catenin) that affect {$\beta$}-catenin stability and are predominantly cystic in appearance. PCPs frequently harbour somatic BRAFV600E mutations and are typically solid tumours. Clinical manifestations due to increased intracranial pressure, visual impairment and endocrine deficiencies should prompt imaging investigations, preferentially MRI. Treatment comprises neurosurgery and radiotherapy; intracystic chemotherapy is used in monocystic ACP. Although long-term survival is high, quality of life and neuropsychological function are frequently impaired due to the close anatomical proximity to the optic chiasm, hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Indeed, hypothalamic involvement and treatment-related hypothalamic lesions frequently result in hypothalamic obesity, physical fatigue and psychosocial deficits. Given the rarity of these tumours, efforts to optimize infrastructure and international collaboration should be research priorities.},

To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte development and differentiation in 40\% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7\% of cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3 (also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis. Moreover, these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches to identify new molecular lesions in cancer.},

Although oxidation-dependent pathways for demethylation have been described, pathways involving deamination of either 5-methylcytosine (5mC) or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have emerged as alternatives. Here we address the biochemical plausibility of deamination-coupled demethylation. We found that purified AID/APOBECs have substantially reduced activity on 5mC relative to cytosine, their canonical substrate, and no detectable deamination of 5hmC. This finding was explained by the reactivity of a series of modified substrates, where steric bulk was increasingly detrimental to deamination. Further, upon AID/APOBEC overexpression, the deamination product of 5hmC was undetectable in genomic DNA, whereas oxidation intermediates remained detectable. Our results indicate that the steric requirements for cytosine deamination are one intrinsic barrier to the proposed function of deaminases in DNA demethylation.},

  abstract = {Human tumors are comprised of heterogeneous cell populations that display diverse molecular and phenotypic features. To examine the extent to which epigenetic differences contribute to intratumoral cellular heterogeneity, we have developed a high-throughput method, termed MAPit-patch. The method uses multiplexed amplification of targeted sequences from submicrogram quantities of genomic DNA followed by next generation bisulfite sequencing. This provides highly scalable and simultaneous mapping of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules at high resolution. Long sequencing reads from targeted regions maintain the structural integrity of epigenetic information and provide substantial depth of coverage, detecting for the first time minority subpopulations of epigenetic configurations formerly obscured by existing genome-wide and population-ensemble methodologies. Analyzing a cohort of 71 promoters of genes with exons commonly mutated in cancer, MAPit-patch uncovered several differentially accessible and methylated promoters that are associated with altered gene expression between neural stem cell (NSC) and glioblastoma (GBM) cell populations. In addition, considering each promoter individually, substantial epigenetic heterogeneity was observed across the sequenced molecules, indicating the presence of epigenetically distinct cellular subpopulations. At the divergent MLH1/EPM2AIP1 promoter, a locus with three well-defined, nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs), a fraction of promoter copies with inaccessible chromatin was detected and enriched upon selection of temozolomide-tolerant GBM cells. These results illustrate the biological relevance of epigenetically distinct subpopulations that in part underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumor cell populations. Furthermore, these findings show that alterations in chromatin accessibility without accompanying changes in DNA methylation may constitute a novel class of epigenetic biomarker.},

We show that chromosomal compartments, topological-associated domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops, all defined by bulk Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell-cycle dynamics. In particular, DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments and a reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 to S and G2 phase. Whole-genome three-dimensional structural models reveal a radial architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our single-cell data therefore allow re-interpretation of chromosome conformation maps through the prism of the cell cycle.},

Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.},

We assayed the GBM methylome with MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq, adjusting for copy number differences, in a small set of non-glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (non-G-CIMP) primary tumors. Recurrent hypomethylated loci were enriched within a region of chromosome 5p15 that is specified as a cancer amplicon and also encompasses TERT, encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase, which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Overall, 76 gene body promoters were recurrently hypomethylated, including TERT and the oncogenes GLI3 and TP73. Recurring hypomethylation also affected previously unannotated alternative promoters, and luciferase reporter assays for three of four of these promoters confirmed strong promoter activity in GBM cells. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq on tissue from the GBMs uncovered peaks that coincide precisely with tumor-specific decrease of DNA methylation at 200 loci, 133 of which are in gene bodies. Detailed investigation of TP73 and TERT gene body hypomethylation demonstrated increased expression of corresponding alternate transcripts, which in TP73 encodes a truncated p73 protein with oncogenic function and in TERT encodes a putative reverse transcriptase-null protein. Our findings suggest that recurring gene body promoter hypomethylation events, along with histone H3K4 trimethylation, alter the transcriptional landscape of GBM through the activation of a limited number of normally silenced promoters within gene bodies, in at least one case leading to expression of an oncogenic protein.},

  abstract = {Background: Topologically associating domains (TADs) are genomic regions of selfinteraction. Additionally, it is known that TAD boundaries are enriched in CTCF binding sites. In turn, CTCF sites are known to be asymmetric, whereby the convergent configuration of a pair of CTCF sites leads to the formation of a chromatin loop in vivo. However, to date, it has been unclear how to reconcile TAD structure with CTCF-based chromatin loops. Results: We approach this problem by analysing CTCF binding site strengths and classifying clusters of CTCF sites along the genome on the basis of their relative orientation. Analysis of CTCF site orientation classes as a function of their spatial distribution along the human genome reveals that convergent CTCF site clusters are depleted while divergent CTCF clusters are enriched in the 5- to 100-kb range. We then analyse the distribution of CTCF binding sites as a function of TAD boundary conservation across seven primary human blood cell types. This reveals divergent CTCF site enrichment at TAD boundaries. Furthermore, convergent arrays of CTCF sites separate the left and right sections of TADs that harbour internal CTCF sites, resulting in unequal TAD `halves'. Conclusions: The orientation-based CTCF binding site cluster classification that we present reconciles TAD boundaries and CTCF site clusters in a mechanistically elegant fashion. This model suggests that the emergent structure of nuclear chromatin in the form of TADs relies on the obligate alternation of divergent and convergent CTCF site clusters that occur at different length scales along the genome.},

It has been associated with selection of cells displaying hypomethylation of enhancer of cell proliferation (PTPN6) and drug efflux gene promoters (ABCB1), as well as hypermethylation of promoter regions of pro-apoptotic genes (APAF1, DAPK1, DOK2), or altered promoter methylation patterns of DNA repair genes (AGF, FANCF, MLH1, SRBC). Promoter hypomethylation of PTPN6 can favor the efflux of drugs, proliferation, and differentiation, and thereby the selection of tumor cell subpopulations that are resistant to chemotherapy. In addition, hypomethylation of many other genes can favor accumulation of somatic mutation and apoptosis resistance and thus the selection of resistant tumor cell subpopulations. The important contribution of DNA methylation in drug resistance implies the possibility of preventing or abolishing drug resistance by reverting the cancer epigenome of non-responsive cells to a drug-responsive state.},

Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.},

  abstract = {Rare diseases, an emerging global public health priority, require an evidence-based estimate of the global point prevalence to inform public policy. We used the publicly available epidemiological data in the Orphanet database to calculate such a prevalence estimate. Overall, Orphanet contains information on 6172 unique rare diseases; 71.9\% of which are genetic and 69.9\% which are exclusively pediatric onset. Global point prevalence was calculated using rare disease prevalence data for predefined geographic regions from the `Orphanet Epidemiological file' (http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/epidemio.html). Of the 5304 diseases defined by point prevalence, 84.5\% of those analysed have a point prevalence of {$<$}1/1 000 000. However 77.3\textendash 80.7\% of the population burden of rare diseases is attributable to the 4.2\% (n\,=\,149) diseases in the most common prevalence range (1\textendash 5 per 10 000). Consequently national definitions of `Rare Diseases' (ranging from prevalence of 5 to 80 per 100 000) represent a variable number of rare disease patients despite sharing the majority of rare disease in their scope. Our analysis yields a conservative, evidence-based estimate for the population prevalence of rare diseases of 3.5\textendash 5.9\%, which equates to 263\textendash 446 million persons affected globally at any point in time. This figure is derived from data from 67.6\% of the prevalent rare diseases; using the European definition of 5 per 10 000; and excluding rare cancers, infectious diseases, and poisonings. Future registry research and the implementation of rare disease codification in healthcare systems will further refine the estimates.},

We sequenced the exomes of five metastatic tumors and healthy kidney tissue from an index case with mCRPC to identify lesions associated with disease progression and metastasis. An Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) germline founder mutation, del185AG in BRCA1, was observed and AJ ancestry was confirmed. Sixty-two somatic variants altered proteins in tumors, including cancer-associated genes, TMPRSS2-ERG, PBRM1, and TET2. The majority (n = 53) of somatic variants were present in all metastases and only a subset (n = 31) was observed in the primary tumor. Integrating tumor next-generation sequencing and DNA copy number showed somatic loss of BRCA1 and TMPRSS2-ERG. We sequenced 19 genes with deleterious mutations in the index case in additional mCRPC samples and detected a frameshift, two somatic missense alterations, tumor loss of heterozygosity, and combinations of germline missense SNPs in TET2. In summary, genetic analysis of metastases from an index case permitted us to infer a chronology for the clonal spread of disease based on sequential accrual of somatic lesions. The role of TET2 in mCRPC deserves additional analysis and may define a subset of metastatic disease.},

  abstract = {Genetic alterations associated with prostate cancer (PCa) may be identified by sequencing metastatic tumour genomes to identify molecular markers at this lethal stage of disease. Previously, we characterized somatic alterations in metastatic tumours in the methylcytosine dioxygenase ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2), which is altered in 5\textendash 15\% of myeloid, kidney, colon and PCas. Genome-wide association studies previously identified non-coding risk variants associated with PCa and melanoma. We perform fine-mapping of PCa risk across TET2 using genotypes from the PEGASUS case-control cohort and identify six new risk variants in introns 1 and 2. Oligonucleotides containing two risk variants are bound by the transcription factor octamer-binding protein 1 (Oct1/POU2F1) and TET2 and Oct1 expression are positively correlated in prostate tumours. TET2 is expressed in normal prostate tissue and reduced in a subset of tumours from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Small interfering RNA-mediated TET2 knockdown (KD) increases LNCaP cell proliferation, migration and wound healing, verifying loss drives a cancer phenotype. Endogenous TET2 bound the androgen receptor (AR) and AR-coactivator proteins in LNCaP cell extracts, and TET2 KD increases prostate-specific antigen (KLK3/PSA) expression. Published data reveal TET2 binding sites and hydroxymethylcytosine proximal to KLK3. A gene co-expression network identified using TCGA prostate tumour RNA-sequencing identifies co-regulated cancer genes associated with 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and succinate metabolism, including TET2, lysine demethylase (KDM) KDM6A, BRCA1-associated BAP1, and citric acid cycle enzymes IDH1/2, SDHA/B, and FH. The co-expression signature is conserved across 31 TCGA cancers suggesting a putative role for TET2 as an energy sensor (of 2-OG) that modifies aspects of androgen-AR signalling. Decreased TET2 mRNA expression in TCGA PCa tumours is strongly associated with reduced patient survival, indicating reduced expression in tumours may be an informative biomarker of disease progression and perhaps metastatic disease.},

We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.},

Here, we combined high-throughput chromosome conformation capture and gene silencing to obtain insights into TAD dynamics in               Xenopus tropicalis               embryos. First, TAD establishment in               X. tropicalis               is similar to that in mice and flies and does not depend on zygotic genome transcriptional activation. This process is followed by further refinements in active and repressive chromatin compartments and the appearance of loops and stripes. Second, within TADs, higher self-interaction frequencies at one end of the boundary are associated with higher DNA occupancy of the architectural proteins CTCF and Rad21. Third, the chromatin remodeling factor ISWI is required for de novo TAD formation. Finally, TAD structures are variable in different tissues. Our work shows that               X. tropicalis               is a powerful model for chromosome architecture analysis and suggests that chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in de novo TAD establishment.},

Unfortunately, for students who are preparing for a research career, this type of curriculum fails to address many of the day-to-day organizational challenges associated with performing computational experiments. In practice, the principles behind organizing and documenting computational experiments are often learned on the fly, and this learning is strongly influenced by personal predilections as well as by chance interactions with collaborators or colleagues. The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal. These are simply the principles and practices that I have developed over 12 years of bioinformatics research, augmented with various suggestions from other researchers with whom I have discussed these issues.},

No\'e et al. used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting. Science, this issue p. eaaw1147; see also p. 982 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONStatistical mechanics aims to compute the average behavior of physical systems on the basis of their microscopic constituents. For example, what is the probability that a protein will be folded at a given temperature? If we could answer such questions efficiently, then we could not only comprehend the workings of molecules and materials, but we could also design drug molecules and materials with new properties in a principled way.To this end, we need to compute statistics of the equilibrium states of many-body systems. In the protein-folding example, this means to consider each of the astronomically many ways to place all protein atoms in space, to compute the probability of each such ``configuration'' in the equilibrium ensemble, and then to compare the total probability of unfolded and folded configurations.As enumeration of all configurations is infeasible, one instead must attempt to sample them from their equilibrium distribution. However, we currently have no way to generate equilibrium samples of many-body systems in ``one shot.'' The main approach is thus to start with one configuration, e.g., the folded protein state, and make tiny changes to it over time, e.g., by using Markov-chain Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics (MD). However, these simulations get trapped in metastable (long-lived) states: For example, sampling a single folding or unfolding event with atomistic MD may take a year on a supercomputer. RATIONALEHere, we combine deep machine learning and statistical mechanics to develop Boltzmann generators. Boltzmann generators are trained on the energy function of a many-body system and learn to provide unbiased, one-shot samples from its equilibrium state. This is achieved by training an invertible neural network to learn a coordinate transformation from a system's configurations to a so-called latent space representation, in which the low-energy configurations of different states are close to each other and can be easily sampled. Because of the invertibility, every latent space sample can be back-transformed to a system configuration with high Boltzmann probability (Fig. 1). We then employ statistical mechanics, which offers a rich set of tools for reweighting the distribution generated by the neural network to the Boltzmann distribution. RESULTSBoltzmann generators can be trained to directly generate independent samples of low-energy structures of condensed-matter systems and protein molecules. When initialized with a few structures from different metastable states, Boltzmann generators can generate statistically independent samples from these states and efficiently compute the free-energy differences between them. This capability could be used to compute relative stabilities between different experimental structures of protein or other organic molecules, which is currently a very challenging problem. Boltzmann generators can also learn a notion of ``reaction coordinates'': Simple linear interpolations between points in latent space have a high probability of corresponding to physically realistic, low-energy transition pathways. Finally, by using established sampling methods such as Metropolis Monte Carlo in the latent space variables, Boltzmann generators can discover new states and gradually explore state space. CONCLUSIONBoltzmann generators can overcome rare event\textendash sampling problems in many-body systems by learning to generate unbiased equilibrium samples from different metastable states in one shot. They differ conceptually from established enhanced sampling methods, as no reaction coordinates are needed to drive them between metastable states. However, by applying existing sampling methods in the latent spaces learned by Boltzmann generators, a plethora of new opportunities opens up to design efficient sampling methods for many-body systems. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6457/eaaw1147/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Boltzmann generators overcome sampling problems between long-lived states.The Boltzmann generator works as follows: 1.

To compute thermodynamics quantities, the samples are reweighted to the Boltzmann distribution using statistical mechanics methods. Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in ``one shot,'' vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates. By combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, neural networks sample the equilibrium distribution of many-body systems.

  abstract = {Feedback loops in gene regulatory networks play pivotal roles in governing functional dynamics of cells. Systems approaches demonstrated characteristic dynamical features, including multistability and oscillation, of positive and negative feedback loops. Recent experiments and theories have implicated highly interconnected feedback loops (high-feedback loops) in additional nonintuitive functions, such as controlling cell differentiation rate and multistep cell lineage progression. However, it remains challenging to identify and visualize high-feedback loops in complex gene regulatory networks due to the myriad of ways in which the loops can be combined. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the high-feedback loop structures with these potential functions are widespread in biological systems. Finally, it remains challenging to understand diverse dynamical features, such as high-order multistability and oscillation, generated by individual networks containing high-feedback loops. To address these problems, we developed HiLoop, a toolkit that enables discovery, visualization, and analysis of several types of high-feedback loops in large biological networks. HiLoop not only extracts high-feedback structures and visualize them in intuitive ways, but also quantifies the enrichment of overrepresented structures. Through random parameterization of mathematical models derived from target networks, HiLoop presents characteristic features of the underlying systems, including complex multistability and oscillations, in a unifying framework. Using HiLoop, we were able to analyze realistic gene regulatory networks containing dozens to hundreds of genes, and to identify many small high-feedback systems. We found more than a 100 human transcription factors involved in high-feedback loops that were not studied previously. In addition, HiLoop enabled the discovery of an enrichment of high feedback in pathways related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HiLoop makes the study of complex networks accessible without significant computational demands. It can serve as a hypothesis generator through identification and modeling of high-feedback subnetworks, or as a quantification method for motif enrichment analysis. As an example of discovery, we found that multistep cell lineage progression may be driven by either specific instances of high-feedback loops with sparse appearances, or generally enriched topologies in gene regulatory networks. We expect HiLoop's usefulness to increase as experimental data of regulatory networks accumulate. Code is freely available for use or extension at https://github.com/BenNordick/HiLoop .},

Norman et al. developed a framework for mapping and understanding GIs. This approach leverages high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data gathered from CRISPR-mediated, pooled perturbation screens. Diverse transcriptomic phenotypes construct a ``manifold'' representing all possible states of the cell. Each perturbation and GI projects the cell state to a particular position on this manifold, enabling unbiased ordering of genes in pathways and systematic classifications of GIs. Science, this issue p. 786 How cellular and organismal complexity emerges from combinatorial expression of genes is a central question in biology. High-content phenotyping approaches such as Perturb-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing pooled CRISPR screens) present an opportunity for exploring such genetic interactions (GIs) at scale. Here, we present an analytical framework for interpreting high-dimensional landscapes of cell states (manifolds) constructed from transcriptional phenotypes. We applied this approach to Perturb-seq profiling of strong GIs mined from a growth-based, gain-of-function GI map. Exploration of this manifold enabled ordering of regulatory pathways, principled classification of GIs (e.g., identifying suppressors), and mechanistic elucidation of synergistic interactions, including an unexpected synergy between CBL and CNN1 driving erythroid differentiation. Finally, we applied recommender system machine learning to predict interactions, facilitating exploration of vastly larger GI manifolds.

  abstract = {Adjusting hematopoietic hierarchy In adults, more than 300 billion blood cells are replenished daily. This output arises from a cellular hierarchy where stem cells differentiate into a series of multilineage progenitors, culminating in unilineage progenitors that generate over 10 different mature blood cell types. Notta et al. mapped the lineage potential of nearly 3000 single cells from 33 different cell populations of stem and progenitor cells from fetal liver, cord blood, and adult bone marrow (see the Perspective by Cabezas-Wallscheid and Trumpp). Prenatally, stem cell and progenitor populations were multilineage with few unilineage progenitors. In adults, multilineage cell potential was only seen in stem cell populations. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aab2116; see also p. 126 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe hematopoietic road map is a compilation of the various lineage differentiation routes that a stem cell takes to make blood. This program produces greater than 10 blood cell fates and is responsible for generating more than 300 billion cells daily. On several occasions over the past six decades, the murine road map has been reconceived due to new information overturning dogma. However, the human road map has changed little. In the human model, blood differentiation initiates at the level of multipotent stem cells and passes through a series of increasingly lineage-restricted oligopotent and, finally, unipotent progenitor intermediates. One critical oligopotent intermediate is the common myeloid progenitor (CMP), believed to be the origin of all myeloid (My), erythroid (Er), and megakaryocyte (Mk) cells. Although murine studies challenge the existence of oligopotent progenitors, a comprehensive analysis of human My-Er-Mk differentiation is lacking. Moreover, whether the pool of oligopotent intermediates is fixed across human development (fetal to adult) is unknown. RATIONALEThe differentiation road map taken by human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is fundamental to our understanding of blood homeostasis, hematopoietic malignancies, and regenerative medicine. RESULTSWe mapped the cellular origins of My, Er, and Mk lineages across three time points in human blood development: fetal liver (FL), neonatal cord blood (CB), and adult bone marrow (BM). Using a cell-sorting scheme based on markers linked to Er and Mk lineage specification (CD71 and CD110), we found that previously described populations of multipotent progenitors (MPPs), CMPs, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) were heterogeneous and could be further purified. Nearly 3000 single cells from 11 cellular subsets from the CD34+ compartment of FL, CB, and BM (33 subsets in total) were evaluated for their My, Er, and Mk lineage potential using an optimized single-cell assay.In FL, the ratio of cells with multilineage versus unilineage potential remained constant in both the stem cell (CD34+CD38\textendash ) and progenitor cell (CD34+CD38+) enriched compartments. By contrast, in BM, nearly all multipotent cells were restricted to the stem cell compartment, whereas unilineage progenitors dominated the progenitor cell compartment. Oligopotent progenitors were only a negligible component of the human blood hierarchy in BM, leading to the inference that multipotent cells differentiate into unipotent cells directly by adulthood.Mk/Er activity predominantly originated from the stem cell compartment at all developmental time points. In CB and BM, most Mks emerged as part of mixed clones from HSCs/MPPs, indicating that Mks directly branch from a multipotent cell and not from oligopotent progenitors like CMP. In FL, an almost pure Mk/Er progenitor was identified in the stem cell compartment, although less potent Mk/Er progenitors were also present in the progenitor compartment. In a hematological condition of HSC loss (aplastic anemia), Mk/Er but not My progenitors were more severely depleted, pinpointing a close physiological connection between HSC and the Mk/Er lineage. CONCLUSIONOur data indicate that there are distinct road maps of blood differentiation across human development. Prenatally, Mk/Er lineage branching occurs throughout the cellular hierarchy. By adulthood, both Mk/Er activity and multipotency are restricted to the stem cell compartment, whereas the progenitor compartment is composed of unilineage progenitors forming a ``two-tier'' system, with few intervening oligopotent intermediates. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/351/6269/aab2116/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Roadmaps of human blood stem cell differentiation.The classical model envisions that oligopotent progenitors such as CMP are an essential intermediate stage from which My/Er/Mk differentiation originates. The redefined model proposes a developmental shift in the progenitor cell architecture from the fetus, where many stem and progenitor cell types are multipotent, to the adult, where the stem cell compartment is multipotent but the progenitors are unipotent. The grayed planes represent theoretical tiers of differentiation. In a classical view of hematopoiesis, the various blood cell lineages arise via a hierarchical scheme starting with multipotent stem cells that become increasingly restricted in their differentiation potential through oligopotent and then unipotent progenitors. We developed a cell-sorting scheme to resolve myeloid (My), erythroid (Er), and megakaryocytic (Mk) fates from single CD34+ cells and then mapped the progenitor hierarchy across human development. Fetal liver contained large numbers of distinct oligopotent progenitors with intermingled My, Er, and Mk fates. However, few oligopotent progenitor intermediates were present in the adult bone marrow. Instead, only two progenitor classes predominate, multipotent and unipotent, with Er-Mk lineages emerging from multipotent cells. The developmental shift to an adult ``two-tier'' hierarchy challenges current dogma and provides a revised framework to understand normal and disease states of human hematopoiesis. As humans age, progenitor cells take over from stem cells the task of producing a steady supply of blood cells.

  abstract = {Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can lead to clonal expansion. We study the evolutionary dynamics of this process and calculate the probability that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene is preceded by mutations in genes that confer genetic instability. Unstable cells might have a slower rate of clonal expansion than stable cells because of an increased probability of generating lethal mutations or inducing apoptosis. We show that the different growth rates of genetically stable and unstable cells during clonal expansion represent, in general, only a small disadvantage for genetic instability. The intuitive reason for this conclusion is that robust clonal expansion, where cellular birth rates are significantly greater than death rates, occurs on a much faster time scale than waiting for those mutations that allow clonal expansion. Moreover, in special cases where clonal expansion is very slow, genetically unstable cells have a higher probability to accumulate additional mutations during clonal expansion that confer a selective advantage. Clonal expansion represents a major disadvantage for genetic instability only when inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene leads to a very small increase of the cellular reproductive rate that is cancelled by the increased mortality of unstable cells.},

  abstract = {Nature is replete with examples of diverse cell types, tissues and body plans, forming very different creatures from genomes with similar gene complements. However, while the genes and the structures of proteins they encode can be highly conserved, the production of those proteins in specific cell types and at specific developmental time points might differ considerably between species. A full understanding of the factors that orchestrate gene expression will be essential to fully understand evolutionary variety. Transcription factor (TF) proteins, which form gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to act in cooperative or competitive partnerships to regulate gene expression, are key components of these unique regulatory programs. Although many TFs are conserved in structure and function, certain classes of TFs display extensive levels of species diversity. In this review, we highlight families of TFs that have expanded through gene duplication events to create species-unique repertoires in different evolutionary lineages. We discuss how the hierarchical structures of GRNs allow for flexible small to large-scale phenotypic changes. We survey evidence that explains how newly evolved TFs may be integrated into an existing GRN and how molecular changes in TFs might impact the GRNs. Finally, we review examples of traits that evolved due to lineage-specific TFs and species differences in GRNs.},

Further, Pax5 functions to promote B cell commitment by repressing lineage-inappropriate gene expression and reinforcing B cell-specific gene expression. In this review, we focus on recent studies that have revealed that instead of a simple transcriptional hierarchy, efficient B cell commitment and differentiation requires the combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors in a complex gene regulatory network.},

Molecularly, treatment with the inhibitors led to a reversal of the DNA cytosine hypermethylation patterns caused by mutant IDH1 in the cells of individuals with AML.

These enhancer sequences are further marked by combinatorial patterns of histone modification or occupancy by CBP or p300, indicative of their context-dependent function.The presence of H3K27ac (histone 3 acetylated at lysine 27) or H3K27me3 (histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27) specifies whether an enhancer is active or poised for activation, respectively.Extensive intra- and interchromosomal interactions between enhancers and promoters are detected at many co-regulated genes during development.Chromatin looping between enhancer and promoter are in part mediated by the interaction between specific transcription factors, CCCTC-binding factor, mediator and/or the cohesin complex.Transcription of long intergenic ncRNAs from some enhancers can regulate expression of their neighbouring genes by targeting specific chromatin modifying factors to their promoter regions.The FOS-like antigen 1 (FOSL1) enhancer appears to facilitate the recruitment of histone-modifying complexes that trigger RNA polymerase II release from promoter-proximal pausing, rather than initiation, and productive transcription from its cognate promoter.},

We also observed                 IGF2                 enhancer-based SVs, previously noted in colorectal cancer, highlighting a common non-coding genetic driver alteration in gastric and colorectal malignancies.                                                        Conclusion               Integrated paired-end NanoChIP-seq and WGS of gastric tumours reveals tumour-associated regulatory SV in regions associated with both simple and complex genomic rearrangements. Genomic rearrangements may thus exploit enhancer-hijacking as a common mechanism to drive oncogene expression in GC.},

  abstract = {CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) plays a key role in the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops in interphase. During mitosis TADs are absent, but how TAD formation is dynamically controlled during the cell cycle is not known. Several contradicting observations have been made regarding CTCF binding to mitotic chromatin using both genomics- and microscopy-based techniques. Here, we have used four different assays to address this debate. First, using 5C, we confirmed that TADs and CTCF loops are readily detected in interphase, but absent during prometaphase. Second, ATAC-seq analysis showed that CTCF sites display greatly reduced accessibility and lose the CTCF footprint in prometaphase, suggesting loss of CTCF binding and rearrangement of the nucleosomal array around the binding motif. In contrast, transcription start sites remain accessible in prometaphase, although adjacent nucleosomes can also become repositioned and occupy at least a subset of start sites during mitosis. Third, loss of site-specific CTCF binding was directly demonstrated using CUT\&RUN. Histone modifications and histone variants are maintained in mitosis, suggesting a role in bookmarking of active CTCF sites. Finally, live-cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and single molecule tracking showed that almost all CTCF chromatin binding is lost in prometaphase. Combined, our results demonstrate loss of CTCF binding to CTCF sites during prometaphase and rearrangement of the chromatin landscape around CTCF motifs. This, combined with loss of cohesin, would contribute to the observed loss of TADs and CTCF loops during mitosis and reveals that CTCF sites, key architectural cis-elements, display cell cycle stage\textendash dependent dynamics in factor binding and nucleosome positioning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep sequencing for transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) in mammals. As RNA-seq becomes more affordable, whole genome transcriptional profiling is likely to become the platform of choice for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data. RESULTS: We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript. CONCLUSION: Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.

Similarly, it has long been hypothesized that the spatial organization (in three dimensions evolving through time), as part of the epigenome, makes a significant contribution to the genotype-phenotype transition. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC, and ChIA-Pet) are increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype. The apparent simplicity of these methodologies\textemdash crosslink chromatin, digest, dilute, ligate, detect interactions\textemdash belies the complexity of the data and the considerations that should be taken into account to ensure the generation and accurate interpretation of reliable data.

Overexpression of               EVI1               is found in a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 3q26 chromosomal rearrangements, which is often therapy resistant. In AMLs harboring a t(3;8)(q26;q24), we observed the translocation of a               MYC               super-enhancer (               MYC               SE) to the               EVI1               locus. We generated an in vitro model mimicking a patient-based t(3;8)(q26;q24) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and demonstrated hyperactivation of               EVI1               by the hijacked               MYC               SE. This               MYC               SE contains multiple enhancer modules, of which only one recruits transcription factors active in early hematopoiesis. This enhancer module is critical for               EVI1               overexpression as well as enhancer-promoter interaction. Multiple CTCF binding regions in the               MYC               SE facilitate this enhancer-promoter interaction, which also involves a CTCF binding site upstream of the               EVI1               promoter. We hypothesize that this CTCF site acts as an enhancer-docking site in t(3;8) AML. Genomic analyses of other 3q26-rearranged AML patient cells point to a common mechanism by which               EVI1               uses this docking site to hijack enhancers active in early hematopoiesis.},

In addition to describing the models and the different approaches to inference, we also explain how methods are related to each other. A key result is that we show how inference with many of the models results in identical estimates of relative abundances, even though model formulations can be very different. In fact, we are able to show how a single general model captures many of the elements of previously published methods. We also review the applications of RNA-Seq models to differential analysis, and explain why accurate relative transcript abundance estimates are crucial for downstream analyses.},

Although 93\% of patients achieved remission, 41\% relapsed at a median of 13 months (range, 28 days to 12 years). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 42\% (95\% confidence interval, 39, 44). Transcriptome sequencing, gene expression profiling, cytogenetics, and fusion polymerase chain reaction enabled genomic subtyping of 282 patient samples, of which 264 were eligible for trial, accounting for 64.5\% of E2993 patients. Among patients with outcome data, 29.5\% with favorable outcomes (5-year OS 65\% to 80\%) were deemed standard risk (DUX4-rearranged [9.2\%], ETV6-RUNX1/-like [2.3\%], TCF3-PBX1 [6.9\%], PAX5 P80R [4.1\%], high-hyperdiploid [6.9\%]); 50.2\% had high-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 0\% to 27\% (Ph-like [21.2\%], KMT2A-AFF1 [12\%], low-hypodiploid/near-haploid [14.3\%], BCL2/MYC-rearranged [2.8\%]); 20.3\% had intermediate-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 33\% to 45\% (PAX5alt [12.4\%], ZNF384/-like [5.1\%], MEF2D-rearranged [2.8\%]).

Of patients considered high risk based on presenting age and white blood cell count, 40\% harbored subtype-defining genetic alterations associated with standard- or intermediate-risk outcomes.

  abstract = {Epigenetic alterations such as promoter hypermethylation may drive cancer through tumor suppressor genes inactivation. However, we have limited ability to differentiate driver DNA methylation (DNAme) changes from passenger events. We developed DNAme driver inference - MethSig - accounting for the varying stochastic hypermethylation rate across the genome and between samples. We applied MethSig to bisulfite sequencing data of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, ductal carcinoma in situ, glioblastoma, and to methylation array data across 18 tumor types in TCGA. MethSig resulted in well-calibrated Quantile-Quantile plots and reproducible inference of likely DNAme drivers with increased sensitivity/specificity compared to benchmarked methods. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of selected candidate CLL DNAme drivers provided a fitness advantage with and without therapeutic intervention. Notably, DNAme driver risk score was closely associated with adverse outcome in independent CLL cohorts. Collectively, MethSig represents a novel inference framework for DNAme driver discovery to chart the role of aberrant DNAme in cancer.},

Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has emerged recently as the technology of choice to profile DNA methylation because of its accuracy, genome coverage, and higher resolution. Current statistical methods to identify differential methylation mainly focus on comparing two treatment groups. With an increasing number of experiments performed under a general and multiple-factor design, particularly in reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, there is a need to develop more flexible, powerful and computationally efficient methods.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: We present a novel statistical model to detect differentially methylated loci from BS-seq data under general experimental design, based on a beta-binomial regression model with "arcsine" link function. Parameter estimation is based on transformed data with generalized least square approach without relying on iterative algorithm. Simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that our method is accurate, powerful, robust and computationally efficient.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAVAILABILITY: It is available as Bioconductor package DSS.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONTACT: yongpark@pitt.edu, hao.wu@emory.edu.},

  abstract = {The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and is a frequent target of chromosomal translocations leading to leukemia. MLL plant homeodomain 3 (PHD3) is lost in all MLL translocation products, and reinsertion of PHD3 into MLL fusion proteins abrogates their transforming activity. PHD3 has been shown to interact with the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain of human nuclear Cyclophilin33 (CYP33). Here, we show that CYP33 mediates downregulation of the expression of MLL target genes HOXC8, HOXA9, CDKN1B, and C-MYC, in a proline isomerase-dependent manner. This downregulation correlates with the reduction of trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and histone H3 acetylation. We have structurally characterized both the PHD3 and CYP33 RRM domains and analyzed their binding to one another. The PHD3 domain binds H3K4me3 (preferentially) and the CYP33 RRM domain at distinct sites. Our binding data show that binding of H3K4me3 to PHD3 and binding of the CYP33 RRM domain to PHD3 are mutually inhibitory, implying that PHD3 is a molecular switch for the transition between activation and repression of target genes. To explore the possible mechanism of CYP33/PHD3-mediated repression, we have analyzed the CYP33 proline isomerase activity on various H3 and H4 peptides and shown selectivity for two sites in H3. Our results provide a possible mechanism for the MLL PHD3 domain to act as a switch between activation and repression.},

Epigenetic methylation of the CpGs constituting these DMRs is established in the germline, resulting in a 5-methylcytosine-specific pattern that is tightly maintained in somatic tissues. Here, we show a novel epigenetic mark, characterized by strand-specific hemimethylation of contiguous CpG sites affecting the germline DMR of the murine Peg3, but not Snrpn, imprinted domain. This modification is enriched in tetraploid cortical neurons, a cell type where evidence for a small proportion of formylmethylated CpG sites within the Peg3-controlling DMR is also provided. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based transcriptional analysis indicated that these epigenetic modifications participate in the maintainance of the monoallelic expression pattern of the Peg3 imprinted gene. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that the methylation pattern observed in DMRs controlling defined imprinting regions can be modified in somatic cells, resulting in a novel epigenetic modification that gives rise to strand-specific hemimethylated domains functional for genomic imprinting. We anticipate the existence of a novel molecular mechanism regulating the transition from fully methylated CpGs to strand-specific hemimethylated CpGs.},

The alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition, (3) use of glycolysis/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment.},

By using this approach, we sequenced longitudinally collected acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor populations from two patients and genotyped up to 62 disease relevant loci across more than 16,000 individual cells. Targeted single-cell sequencing was able to sensitively identify cells harboring pathogenic mutations during complete remission and uncovered complex clonal evolution within AML tumors that was not observable with bulk sequencing.

A sample, however, may contain a number of distinct methylation patterns. For instance, cells of different types and in different developmental stages may have different methylation patterns. Alleles may be differentially methylated, which may partially explain that the large portions of epigenomes from single cell types are partially methylated, and may have major effects on transcriptional output. Approaches relying on DNA sequence polymorphism to identify individual patterns from a mixture of heterogeneous epigenomes are insufficient as methylcytosines occur at a much higher density than SNPs. RESULTS: We have developed a mixture model-based approach for resolving distinct epigenomes from a heterogeneous sample. In particular, the model is applied to the detection of allele-specific methylation (ASM). The methods are tested on a synthetic methylome and applied to an Arabidopsis single root cell methylome.},

The LINE1 retrotransposon is the most abundant class and is thought to be deleterious for cells, yet it is paradoxically highly expressed during early development. Here, we report that LINE1 plays essential roles in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and pre-implantation embryos. In ESCs, LINE1 acts as a nuclear RNA scaffold that recruits Nucleolin and Kap1/Trim28 to repress Dux, the master activator of a transcriptional program specific to the 2-cell embryo. In parallel, LINE1 RNA mediates binding of Nucleolin and Kap1 to rDNA, promoting rRNA synthesis and ESC self-renewal. In embryos, LINE1 RNA is required for Dux silencing, synthesis of rRNA, and exit from the 2-cell stage. The results reveal an essential partnership between LINE1 RNA, Nucleolin, Kap1, and peri-nucleolar chromatin in the regulation of transcription, developmental potency, and ESC self-renewal.},

Current clinical handling includes surgery as first-line treatment. Cytotoxic therapies (radiotherapy RT or chemotherapy QT) are used initially only for patients having a bad prognosis. Therapies are administered following the 'maximum dose in minimum time' principle, which is the same schedule used for high-grade brain tumours. Using mathematical models describing the growth of these tumours in response to radiotherapy, we find that an extreme protraction therapeutical strategy, i.e. enlarging substantially the time interval between RT fractions, may lead to better tumour control. Explicit formulas are found providing the optimal spacing between doses in a very good agreement with the simulations of the full 3D mathematical model approximating the tumour spatiotemporal dynamics. This idea, although breaking the well-established paradigm, has biological meaning since, in these slowly growing tumours, it may be more favourable to treat the tumour as the tumour cells leave the quiescent compartment and move into the cell cycle.},

Results: Alterations in methylation states of genes previously implicated in prostate cancer progression were observed and patients that maintained methylation changes throughout therapy tended to have a longer time to clinical progression. Importantly, we also report that markers associated with a highly aggressive form of the disease, neuroendocrine-CRPC, were associated with a faster time to clinical progression.

  abstract = {Background: The identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model. Results: We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons. Conclusions: The agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.},

Here we report the use of polymerase chain reaction-aided genomic sequencing to determine the complete methylation pattern of this region in clones derived from X8-6T2 cells after treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. We find (i) a clone showing full expression of human phosphoglycerate kinase is fully unmethylated in this region; (ii) clones not expressing human phosphoglycerate kinase remain methylated at approximately 50\% of CpG sites, with a pattern of interspersed methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) sites different for each clone; (iii) singles, defined as M-U-M or U-M-U, are common; and (iv) a few CpG sites are partially methylated. The data are interpreted according to a model of multiple, autonomous CpG sites, and estimates are made for two key parameters, maintenance efficiency (Em approximately 99.9\% per site per generation) and de novo methylation efficiency (Ed approximately 5\%). These parameter values and the hypothesis that several independent sites must be unmethylated for transcription can explain the stable maintenance of X chromosome inactivation. We also consider how the active region is kept free of methylation and suggest that transcription inhibits methylation by decreasing Em so that methylation cannot be maintained. Thus, multiple CpG sites, independent with respect to a dynamic methylation system, can stabilize two alternative states of methylation and transcription.},

However, while these tools are advancing our ability to understand and manipulate this regulatory layer of the genome, they still possess a variety of limitations in efficacy, implementation, and targeting specificity. Effective targeted DNA methylation editing will continue to advance our fundamental understanding of the role of this modification in different genomic and cellular contexts, and further improvements may enable more accurate disease modeling and possible future treatments.

  abstract = {Detection of DNA methylation in the genome has been possible for decades; however, the ability to deliberately and specifically manipulate local DNA methylation states in the genome has been extremely limited. Consequently, this has impeded our understanding of the direct effect of DNA methylation on transcriptional regulation and transcription factor binding in the native chromatin context. Thus, highly specific targeted epigenome editing tools are needed to address this. Recent adaptations of genome editing technologies, including fusion of the DNMT3A DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain to catalytically inactive Cas9 (dC9-D3A), have aimed to alter DNA methylation at desired loci. Here, we show that these tools exhibit consistent off-target DNA methylation deposition in the genome, limiting their capabilities to unambiguously assess the functional consequences of DNA methylation. To address this, we developed a modular dCas9-SunTag (dC9Sun-D3A) system that can recruit multiple DNMT3A catalytic domains to a target site for editing DNA methylation. dC9Sun-D3A is tunable, specific, and exhibits much higher induction of DNA methylation at target sites than the dC9-D3A direct fusion protein. Importantly, genome-wide characterization of dC9Sun-D3A binding sites and DNA methylation revealed minimal off-target protein binding and induction of DNA methylation with dC9Sun-D3A, compared to pervasive off-target methylation by dC9-D3A. Furthermore, we used dC9Sun-D3A to demonstrate the binding sensitivity to DNA methylation for CTCF and NRF1 in situ. Overall, this modular dC9Sun-D3A system enables precise DNA methylation deposition with the lowest off-target DNA methylation levels reported to date, allowing accurate functional determination of the role of DNA methylation at single loci.},

We demonstrate that dynamic looping events are regulatory rather than structural in nature and uncover widespread coordination of dynamic enhancer activity at preformed and acquired DNA loops. Enhancer-bound loop formation and enhancer activation of preformed loops together form multi-loop activation hubs at key macrophage genes. Activation hubs connect 3.4 enhancers per promoter and exhibit a strong enrichment for activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding events, suggesting that multi-loop activation hubs involving cell-type-specific transcription factors represent an important class of regulatory chromatin structures for the spatiotemporal control of transcription.},

We discovered that within nucleosomes, the somatic mutation rate across several tumor cohorts exhibits a strong 10 base pair (bp) periodicity. This periodic pattern tracks the alternation of the DNA minor groove facing toward and away from the histones. The strength and phase of the mutation rate periodicity are determined by the mutational processes active in tumors. We uncovered similar periodic patterns in the genetic variation among human and Arabidopsis populations, also detectable in their divergence from close species, indicating that the same principles underlie germline and somatic mutation rates. We propose that differential DNA damage and repair processes dependent on the minor groove orientation in nucleosome-bound DNA contribute to the 10-bp periodicity in AT/CG content in eukaryotic genomes.},

  abstract = {Chromosomal translocations are signatures of numerous cancers and lead to expression of fusion genes that act as oncogenes. The wealth of genomic aberrations found in cancer, however, makes it challenging to assign a specific phenotypic change to a specific aberration. In this study, we set out to use genome editing with zinc finger (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector (TALEN) nucleases to engineer, de novo, translocation-associated oncogenes at cognate endogenous loci in human cells. Using ZFNs and TALENs designed to cut precisely at relevant translocation breakpoints, we induced cancer-relevant t(11;22)(q24;q12) and t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocations found in Ewing sarcoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), respectively. We recovered both translocations with high efficiency, resulting in the expression of the EWSR1\textendash FLI1 and NPM1\textendash ALK fusions. Breakpoint junctions recovered after ZFN cleavage in human embryonic stem (ES) cell\textendash derived mesenchymal precursor cells fully recapitulated the genomic characteristics found in tumor cells from Ewing sarcoma patients. This approach with tailored nucleases demonstrates that expression of fusion genes found in cancer cells can be induced from the native promoter, allowing interrogation of both the underlying mechanisms and oncogenic consequences of tumor-related translocations in human cells. With an analogous strategy, the ALCL translocation was reverted in a patient cell line to restore the integrity of the two participating chromosomes, further expanding the repertoire of genomic rearrangements that can be engineered by tailored nucleases.},

In all cases, neomorphic activity of the mutated enzyme leads to production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which has profound cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects. The broad effects of IDH mutations on epigenetic, differentiation and metabolic programmes, together with their high prevalence across a variety of cancer types, early presence in tumorigenesis and uniform expression in tumour cells, make mutant IDH an ideal therapeutic target. Herein, we describe the current biological understanding of IDH mutations and the roles of mutant IDH in the various associated cancers. We also present the available preclinical and clinical data on various methods of targeting IDH-mutant cancers and discuss, based on the underlying pathogenesis of different IDH-mutated cancer types, whether the treatment approaches will converge or be context dependent.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t DNA methylation is a fundamental means of epigenetic gene regulation that occurs in virtually all cell types. In many higher organisms, including humans, it plays vital roles in cell differentiation and homeo-static maintenance of cell phenotype. The control of DNA methylation has traditionally been attributed to a highly coordinated, linear process, whose dysregulation has been associated with numerous pathologies including cancer, where it occurs early in, and even prior to, the development of neoplastic tissues. Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that, contrary to prevailing paradigms, methylation patterns are actually maintained through inexact, dynamic processes. These processes normally result in minor stochastic differences between cells that accumulate with age. However, various factors, including cancer itself, can lead to substantial differences in intercellular methylation patterns, viz. methylation hetero-geneity. Advancements in molecular biology techniques are just now beginning to allow insight into how this heterogeneity contributes to clonal evolution and overall cancer heterogeneity. In the current review, we begin by presenting a didactic overview of how the basal bimodal methylome is established and maintained. We then provide a synopsis of some of the factors that lead to the accrual of heteroge-neous methylation and how this heterogeneity may lead to gene silencing and impact the development of cancerous phenotypes. Lastly, we highlight currently available methylation assessment techniques and discuss their suitability to the study of heterogeneous methylation.},

  abstract = {Many cancers comprise heterogeneous populations of cells at primary and metastatic sites throughout the body. The presence or emergence of distinct subclones with drug-resistant genetic and epigenetic phenotypes within these populations can greatly complicate therapeutic intervention. Liquid biopsies of peripheral blood from cancer patients have been suggested as an ideal means of sampling intratumor genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity for diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutic guidance. However, current molecular diagnostic and sequencing methods are not well suited to the routine assessment of epigenetic heterogeneity in difficult samples such as liquid biopsies that contain intrinsically low fractional concentrations of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and rare epigenetic subclonal populations. Here we report an alternative approach, deemed DREAMing (Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by Melt), which uses semi-limiting dilution and precise melt curve analysis to distinguish and enumerate individual copies of epiallelic species at single-CpG-site resolution in fractions as low as 0.005\%, providing facile and inexpensive ultrasensitive assessment of locus-specific epigenetic heterogeneity directly from liquid biopsies. The technique is demonstrated here for the evaluation of epigenetic heterogeneity at p14ARF and BRCA1 gene-promoter loci in liquid biopsies obtained from patients in association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), respectively.},

This suggests that mutations in regulators of the epigenome are mechanistically linked to the altered epigenome.In this Review, we propose a systematic integrative analysis of profiling data to uncover molecular mechanisms that lead to altered epigenomes.Mutations in regulators of the epigenome are attractive targets for epigenetic therapy.},

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of ``chromatin hubs''\textemdash they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.},

MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-{$\sum$}ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

  abstract = {It is well known, but frequently overlooked, that low- and high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e., systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a biologically significant finding. An integral step towards reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two sources of batch effects: array row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function, ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In the ``initial analysis'', the application of ComBat to an unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant (FDR{$<$}0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a ``revised processing'' included changes to our analysis as well as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports conclusions made by an article previously published in this journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve as a reminder to the broader community to establish research questions a priori, ensure that they match with study design and encourage communication between technicians and analysts.},

Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However, this approach can fail to detect known structures, such as interactions with nuclear bodies, because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies. Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although RNA has been proposed to play a role in nuclear organization, exploring this has been challenging because existing methods cannot measure higher-order RNA and DNA contacts within 3D structures. To address this, we developed RNA \& DNA SPRITE (RD-SPRITE) to comprehensively map the spatial organization of RNA and DNA. These maps reveal higher-order RNA-chromatin structures associated with three major classes of nuclear function: RNA processing, heterochromatin assembly, and gene regulation. These data demonstrate that hundreds of ncRNAs form high-concentration territories throughout the nucleus, that specific RNAs are required to recruit various regulators into these territories, and that these RNAs can shape long-range DNA contacts, heterochromatin assembly, and gene expression. These results demonstrate a mechanism where RNAs form high-concentration territories, bind to diffusible regulators, and guide them into compartments to regulate essential nuclear functions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Despite advances in treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); relapse occurs in approximately 20\% of patients. Nowadays, epigenetic factors are considered as one of the most effective mechanisms in pathogenesis of malignancies. These factors are reversible elements which can be potentially regarded as therapy targets and disease prognosis. DNA methylation, which primarily serves as transcriptional suppressor, mostly occurs in CpG islands of the gene promoter regions. This was shown as a key epigenetic factor in inactivating various tumor suppressor genes during cancer initiation and progression. We aimed to review methylation status of key genes involved in hematopoietic malignancies such as IKZF1, CDKN2B, TET2, CYP1B1, SALL4, DLC1, DLX family, TP73, PTPN6, and CDKN1C; and their significance in pathogenesis of ALL. The DNA methylation alterations in promoter regions of the genes have been shown to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Methylation -based inactivation of these genes has also been reported as associated with prognosis in acute leukemia. In this review, we also addressed the association of gene expression and methylation pattern in ALL patients.},

  abstract = {The highly dynamic nature of chromosome conformation and three-dimensional (3D) genome organization leads to cell-to-cell variability in chromatin interactions within a cell population, even if the cells of the population appear to be functionally homogeneous. Hence, although Hi-C is a powerful tool for mapping 3D genome organization, this heterogeneity of chromosome higher order structure among individual cells limits the interpretive power of population based bulk Hi-C assays. Moreover, single-cell studies have the potential to enable the identification and characterization of rare cell populations or cell subtypes in a heterogeneous population. However, it may require surveying relatively large numbers of single cells to achieve statistically meaningful observations in single-cell studies. By applying combinatorial cellular indexing to chromosome conformation capture, we developed single-cell combinatorial indexed Hi-C (sci-Hi-C), a high throughput method that enables mapping chromatin interactomes in large number of single cells. We demonstrated the use of sci-Hi-C data to separate cells by karytoypic and cell-cycle state differences and to identify cellular variability in mammalian chromosomal conformation. Here, we provide a detailed description of method design and step-by-step working protocols for sci-Hi-C.},

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop. Although reformation rates vary greatly, many megabase-sized loops recovered in under an hour, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid.},

KMT2 family members demonstrate different substrate specificity in vitro and their methyltransferase activities are dependent, to varying degrees, on association with three core subunits (WD repeat protein 5, retinoblastoma binding protein 5 and ASH2L).KMT2 family members have intrinsically different biochemical properties and are recruited to different genomic regions owing to their distinct domain structures and distinct interacting proteins.KMT2 family members have important roles in transcription regulation. Among them, KMT2C and KMT2D are crucial for monomethylation of H3K4 at distal regulatory enhancers, whereas KMT2F and KMT2G are responsible for the majority of H3K4 trimethylation at transcription start sites.There is extensive interplay between KMT2-dependent H3K4 methylation and DNA methylation, underlying the potential epigenetic stability of this histone methylation.Mutations in the KMT2 family are among the most common genetic aberrations in human cancer \textemdash{} including haematological malignancies as well as solid tumours, such as large intestine, lung, endometrial, breast, bladder and brain cancers.Mutations in the KMT2 family frequently involve the SET domain and the plant homeotic domains. Of somatic mutations in cancers with known zygosity, heterozygous mutations predominate. These features suggest that the wild-type KMT2 allele may be required for tumour survival, similar to KMT2A-rearranged mixed lineage leukaemia.KMT2 family members may have distinct roles in cancer. Although it remains unclear whether cancer-derived KMT2 mutations are 'drivers' or 'passengers', mechanistic studies in animal models suggest that KMT2C may be a tumour suppressor and KMT2A and KMT2D may be proteins derived from proto-oncogenes.The targeting of the fusion protein and wild-type KMT2A, as well as their interacting proteins, has emerged as a promising strategy to treat mixed lineage leukaemia, and may apply more broadly to a variety of cancers.},

Clustering of single omic datasets has proven invaluable for biological and medical research.

Clustering multi-omic data has the potential to reveal further systems-level insights, but raises computational and biological challenges. Here, we review algorithms for multi-omics clustering, and discuss key issues in applying these algorithms. Our review covers methods developed specifically for omic data as well as generic multi-view methods developed in the machine learning community for joint clustering of multiple data types. In addition, using cancer data from TCGA, we perform an extensive benchmark spanning ten different cancer types, providing the first systematic comparison of leading multi-omics and multi-view clustering algorithms. The results highlight key issues regarding the use of single- versus multi-omics, the choice of clustering strategy, the power of generic multi-view methods and the use of approximated p-values for gauging solution quality. Due to the growing use of multi-omics data, we expect these issues to be important for future progress in the field.},

We find that deletion of Tet2 in native hematopoiesis as well as fully transformed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in changes in transcription factor (TF) activity within these regions, and we provide evidence that loss of TET2 leads to attenuation of chromatin binding of members of the basic helix\textendash loop\textendash helix (bHLH) TF family. Together, these findings demonstrate that TET2 activity shapes the local chromatin environment at enhancers to facilitate TF binding and provides an example of how epigenetic dysregulation can affect gene expression patterns and drive disease development.},

Real et al. investigated the origin of this trait by sequencing the Iberian mole genome and applying comparative strategies that integrate transcriptomic, epigenetic, and chromatin interaction data. They identified mole-specific genomic rearrangements that alter the three-dimensional regulatory landscape of the androgen-converting gene CYP17A1 and the pro-testicular factor gene FGF9, both of which show distinct expression patterns in mole gonads. The use of transgenic mice confirms the capability of these factors to increase circulating testosterone levels and to induce gonadal masculinization. This study highlights how integrative approaches can reveal the phenotypic impact of genomic variation. Science, this issue p. 208 Linking genomic variation to phenotypical traits remains a major challenge in evolutionary genetics. In this study, we use phylogenomic strategies to investigate a distinctive trait among mammals: the development of masculinizing ovotestes in female moles. By combining a chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Iberian mole, Talpa occidentalis, with transcriptomic, epigenetic, and chromatin interaction datasets, we identify rearrangements altering the regulatory landscape of genes with distinct gonadal expression patterns. These include a tandem triplication involving CYP17A1, a gene controlling androgen synthesis, and an intrachromosomal inversion involving the pro-testicular growth factor gene FGF9, which is heterochronically expressed in mole ovotestes. Transgenic mice with a knock-in mole CYP17A1 enhancer or overexpressing FGF9 showed phenotypes recapitulating mole sexual features. Our results highlight how integrative genomic approaches can reveal the phenotypic impact of noncoding sequence changes. Phylogenomic analyses identify altered regulation at the CYP17A1 and FGF9 loci that contribute to ovotestis formation in moles.

Patients with localized disease at a low to intermediate risk of recurrence generally have a favourable outcome of 99\% overall survival for 10 years if the disease is detected and treated at an early stage. Key genetic alterations include fusions of TMPRSS2 with ETS family genes, amplification of the MYC oncogene, deletion and/or mutation of PTEN and TP53 and, in advanced disease, amplification and/or mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed by prostate biopsy prompted by a blood test to measure prostate-specific antigen levels and/or digital rectal examination. Treatment for localized disease includes active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or ablative radiotherapy as curative approaches. Men whose disease relapses after prostatectomy are treated with salvage radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for local relapse, or with ADT combined with chemotherapy or novel androgen signalling-targeted agents for systemic relapse. Advanced prostate cancer often progresses despite androgen ablation and is then considered castration-resistant and incurable. Current treatment options include AR-targeted agents, chemotherapy, radionuclides and the poly(ADP-ribose) inhibitor olaparib. Current research aims to improve prostate cancer detection, management and outcomes, including understanding the fundamental biology at all stages of the disease.},

  abstract = {Detailed modeling of a species' history is of prime importance for understanding how natural selection operates over time. Most methods designed to detect positive selection along sequenced genomes, however, use simplified representations of past histories as null models of genetic drift. Here, we present the first method that can detect signatures of strong local adaptation across the genome using arbitrarily complex admixture graphs, which are typically used to describe the history of past divergence and admixture events among any number of populations. The method\textemdash called graph-aware retrieval of selective sweeps (GRoSS)\textemdash has good power to detect loci in the genome with strong evidence for past selective sweeps and can also identify which branch of the graph was most affected by the sweep. As evidence of its utility, we apply the method to bovine, codfish, and human population genomic data containing panels of multiple populations related in complex ways. We find new candidate genes for important adaptive functions, including immunity and metabolism in understudied human populations, as well as muscle mass, milk production, and tameness in specific bovine breeds. We are also able to pinpoint the emergence of large regions of differentiation owing to inversions in the history of Atlantic codfish.},

We examined a population of recombinant inbred lines with epigenetically mosaic chromosomes consisting of wild-type and CG methylation-depleted segments (epiRILs). Surprisingly, transposons that were immobile in the parental lines displayed stochastic movement in 28\% of the epiRILs. Although analysis after eight generations of inbreeding, supported by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, identified recombined parental chromosomal segments, these were interspersed with unexpectedly high frequencies of nonparental methylation polymorphism. Hence, epigenetic inheritance in hybrids derived from parents with divergent epigenomes permits long-lasting epi-allelic interactions that violate Mendelian expectations. Such persistently ``unstable'' epigenetic states complicate linkage-based epigenomic mapping. Thus, future epigenomic analyses should consider possible genetic instabilities and alternative mapping strategies.},

Driver mutations may increase cell division, reduce cell death, or allow cells to overcome density-limiting effects. We study the dynamics of tumor growth as one additional driver mutation is acquired. Our models are based on two-type branching processes that terminate in either tumor disappearance or tumor detection. In our first model, both cell types grow exponentially, with a faster rate for cells carrying the additional driver. We find that the additional driver mutation does not affect the survival probability of the lesion, but can substantially reduce the time to reach the detectable size if the lesion is slow growing. In our second model, cells lacking the additional driver cannot exceed a fixed carrying capacity, due to density limitations. In this case, the time to detection depends strongly on this carrying capacity. Our model provides a quantitative framework for studying tumor dynamics during different stages of progression. We observe that early, small lesions need additional drivers, while late stage metastases are only marginally affected by them. These results help to explain why additional driver mutations are typically not detected in fast-growing metastases.},

Relatively little is known about driver gene mutations in metastases, which cause most cancer-related deaths. Reiter et al. explored whether the growth of different metastatic lesions within an individual patient is fueled by the same or distinct gene mutations. In a study of 76 untreated metastases from 20 patients with different types of cancer, all metastases within a patient shared the same functional driver gene mutations. Thus, analysis of a single biopsy could help oncologists select the optimal therapy for patients with widespread metastatic disease. Science, this issue p. 1033 Metastases are responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths. Although genomic heterogeneity within primary tumors is associated with relapse, heterogeneity among treatment-na\"ive metastases has not been comprehensively assessed. We analyzed sequencing data for 76 untreated metastases from 20 patients and inferred cancer phylogenies for breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, lung, melanoma, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. We found that within individual patients, a large majority of driver gene mutations are common to all metastases. Further analysis revealed that the driver gene mutations that were not shared by all metastases are unlikely to have functional consequences. A mathematical model of tumor evolution and metastasis formation provides an explanation for the observed driver gene homogeneity. Thus, single biopsies capture most of the functionally important mutations in metastases and therefore provide essential information for therapeutic decision-making. The growth of different metastatic lesions within an individual cancer patient is fueled by the same genetic mutations.

For example, we show that FOXA1 is enriched in prostate cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loop anchors. We also find that the chromatin structure surrounding the androgen receptor (AR) locus is altered in the prostate cancer cells with many cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loops.

Recent advances in genome-scale mapping of replication kinetics have allowed these correlations to be explored in many species, cell types, and growth conditions, and these large data sets have allowed quantitative and computational analyses. One striking new correlation to emerge from these analyses is between replication timing and the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This correlation, which is significantly stronger than with any single histone modification or chromosome-binding protein, suggests that replication timing is controlled at the level of chromosomal domains. This conclusion dove tails with parallel work on the heterogeneity of origin firing and the competition between origins for limiting activators to suggest a model in which the stochastic probability of individual origin firing is modulated by chromosomal domain structure to produce patterns of replication. Whether these patterns have inherent biological functions or simply reflect higher-order genome structure is an open question.},

Here, we show that in human epidermal stem cells, the two proteins bind in a histone H3K36me3-dependent manner to the most active enhancers and are required to produce their associated enhancer RNAs. Both proteins prefer super-enhancers associated to genes that either define the ectodermal lineage or establish the stem cell and differentiated states. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ in their mechanisms of enhancer regulation: Dnmt3a associates with p63 to maintain high levels of DNA hydroxymethylation at the center of enhancers in a Tet2-dependent manner, whereas Dnmt3b promotes DNA methylation along the body of the enhancer. Depletion of either protein inactivates their target enhancers and profoundly affects epidermal stem cell function. Altogether, we reveal novel functions for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b at enhancers that could contribute to their roles in disease and tumorigenesis.},

Epigenetic mechanisms ensure that genetically identical cells acquire different fates during embryonic development and are therefore essential for the proper progression of development. How they do so is still a matter of intense investigation, but there is sufficient evidence indicating that they act in a concerted manner with inductive signals and tissue-specific transcription factors to promote and stabilize fate changes along the three germ layers during development. In consequence, it is generally hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms are also required for the continuous maintenance of cell fate during adulthood. However, in vivo models in which different epigenetic factors have been depleted in different tissues do not show overt changes in cell lineage, thus not strongly supporting this view. Instead, the function of some of these factors appears to be primarily associated with tissue functionality, and a strong causal relationship has been established between their misregulation and a diseased state. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the role of epigenetic factors in adult stem cell function and tissue homeostasis.},

We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

Compared to other loop callers, such as HiCCUPS and SIP, MUSTACHE recovers a higher number of published ChIA-PET and HiChIP loops as well as loops linking promoters to regulatory elements. Overall, MUSTACHE enables an efficient and comprehensive analysis of chromatin loops. Available at: https://github.com/ay-lab/mustache.},

How nucleosome interaction enables transcription factors to target chromatin and determine cell identity remains elusive. Here, we systematically dissect OCT4 to show that nucleosome binding is encoded within the DNA-binding domain and yet can be uncoupled from free-DNA binding. Furthermore, accelerating the binding kinetics of OCT4 to DNA enhances nucleosome binding. In cells, uncoupling nucleosome binding diminishes the ability of OCT4 to individually access closed chromatin, while more dynamic nucleosome binding results in expansive genome scanning within closed chromatin. However, both uncoupling and enhancing nucleosome binding are detrimental to inducing pluripotency from differentiated cells. Remarkably, stable interactions between OCT4 and nucleosomes are continuously required for maintaining the accessibility of pluripotency enhancers in stem cells. Our findings reveal how the affinity and residence time of OCT4\textendash nucleosome complexes modulate chromatin accessibility during cell fate changes and maintenance.},

One of the proposed causes for these defects in the methylation machinery is overexpression of one or more of the three known catalytically active DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a and 3b, yet there are clearly examples in which overexpression is minimal or non-existent but global methylation anomalies persist. An alternative mechanism which could give rise to global methylation errors is the improper expression of one or more of the DNMTs during the cell cycle. To begin to study the latter possibility we examined the expression of the mRNAs for DNMT1, 3a and 3b during the cell cycle of normal and transformed cells. We found that DNMT1 and 3b levels were significantly downregulated in G(0)/G(1)while DNMT3a mRNA levels were less sensitive to cell cycle alterations and were maintained at a slightly higher level in tumor lines compared to normal cell strains. Enzymatic activity assays revealed a similar decrease in the overall methylation capacity of the cells during G(0)/G(1)arrest and again revealed that a tumor cell line maintained a higher methylation capacity during arrest than a normal cell strain. These results reveal a new level of control exerted over the cellular DNA methylation machinery, the loss of which provides an alternative mechanism for the genesis of the aberrant methylation patterns observed in tumor cells.},

Correct enactment of this process relies on a synergistic interplay between genetically encoded differentiation programs and a host of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. These include the influence of the HSC niche microenvironment, action of specific transcription factors, and alterations in intracellular metabolic state. The consolidation of these inputs with the genetically encoded program into a coherent differentiation program for each lineage is thought to rely on epigenetic modifiers. Recent work has delineated the precise contributions of different classes of epigenetic modifiers to HSC self-renewal as well as lineage specification and differentiation into various cell types. Here, we bring together what is currently known about chromatin status and the development of cells in the hematopoietic system under normal and abnormal conditions.},

In this study, we set out to characterize changes in DNA methylation and gene expression during granulopoiesis using 4 distinct cell populations ranging from the oligopotent common myeloid progenitor stage to terminally differentiated neutrophils. We observed that differentially methylated sites (DMSs) generally show decreased methylation during granulopoiesis. Methylation appears to change at specific differentiation stages and overlap with changes in transcription and activity of key hematopoietic transcription factors. DMSs were preferentially located in areas distal to CpG islands and shores. Also, DMSs were overrepresented in enhancer elements and enriched in enhancers that become active during differentiation. Overall, this study depicts in detail the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during granulopoiesis and supports the role of DNA methylation as a regulatory mechanism in blood cell differentiation.},

Recently it has become clear that the DNA and histone lysine methylation systems are highly interrelated and rely mechanistically on each other for normal chromatin function in vivo. Here we examine some of the functional links between these systems, with a particular focus on several recent discoveries suggesting how lysine methylation may help to target DNA methylation during development, and vice versa. In addition, the emerging role of non-methylated DNA found in CpG islands in defining histone lysine methylation profiles at gene regulatory elements will be discussed in the context of gene regulation.

Using whole-genome sequencing data of the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma, we here identified a type of amplification, termed `seismic amplification', that is characterized by multiple rearrangements and discontinuous copy number levels. Overall, seismic amplifications occurred in 9.9\% (274 of 2,756) of cases across 38 cancer types, and were associated with massively increased copy numbers and elevated oncogene expression. Reconstruction of the development of seismic amplification showed a stepwise evolution, starting with a chromothripsis event, followed by formation of circular extrachromosomal DNA that subsequently underwent repetitive rounds of circular recombination. The resulting amplicons persisted as extrachromosomal DNA circles or had reintegrated into the genome in overt tumors. Together, our data indicate that the sequential occurrence of chromothripsis and circular recombination drives oncogene amplification and overexpression in a substantial fraction of human malignancies.},

We show here that the chief enzyme that maintains mammalian DNA methylation, DNMT1, can also establish a repressive transcription complex. The non-catalytic amino terminus of DNMT1 binds to HDAC2 and a new protein, DMAP1 (for DNMT1 associated protein), and can mediate transcriptional repression. DMAP1 has intrinsic transcription repressive activity, and binds to the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101. DMAP1 is targeted to replication foci through interaction with the far N terminus of DNMT1 throughout S phase, whereas HDAC2 joins DNMT1 and DMAP1 only during late S phase, providing a platform for how histones may become deacetylated in heterochromatin following replication. Thus, DNMT1 not only maintains DNA methylation, but also may directly target, in a heritable manner, transcriptionally repressive chromatin to the genome during DNA replication.},

Identification of these loops is a critical part of most Hi-C analyses. However, current methods often miss visually evident CTCF loops in Hi-C data sets from mammals, and they completely fail to identify high intensity loops in other organisms. We present SIP, Significant Interaction Peak caller, and SIPMeta, which are platform independent programs to identify and characterize these loops in a time- and memory-efficient manner. We show that SIP is resistant to noise and sequencing depth, and can be used to detect loops that were previously missed in human cells as well as loops in other organisms. SIPMeta corrects for a common visualization artifact by accounting for Manhattan distance to create average plots of Hi-C and HiChIP data. We then demonstrate that the use of SIP and SIPMeta can lead to biological insights by characterizing the contribution of several transcription factors to CTCF loop stability in human cells. We also annotate loops associated with the SMC component of the dosage compensation complex (DCC) in Caenorhabditis elegans and demonstrate that loop anchors represent bidirectional blocks for symmetrical loop extrusion. This is in contrast to the asymmetrical extrusion until unidirectional blockage by CTCF that is presumed to occur in mammals. Using HiChIP and multiway ligation events, we then show that DCC loops form a network of strong interactions that may contribute to X Chromosome\textendash wide condensation in C. elegans hermaphrodites.},

Recent evidence suggests that compartments are smaller than previously thought and that the transcriptional or chromatin state is responsible for interactions leading to the formation of small compartmental domains in all organisms. In vertebrates, CTCF forms loop domains, probably via an extrusion process involving cohesin. CTCF loops cooperate with compartmental domains to establish the 3D organization of the genome. The continuous extrusion of the chromatin fibre by cohesin may also be responsible for the establishment of enhancer\textendash promoter interactions and stochastic aspects of the transcription process.

Current computational approaches to analyze chromatin modifications across multiple cell types do not model how the cell types are related on a lineage or over time. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a method called CMINT (Chromatin Module INference on Trees), a probabilistic clustering approach to systematically capture chromatin state dynamics across multiple cell types. Compared to existing approaches, CMINT can handle complex lineage topologies, capture higher quality clusters, and reliably detect chromatin transitions between cell types. We applied CMINT to gain novel insights in two complex processes: reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and hematopoiesis. In reprogramming, chromatin changes could occur without large gene expression changes; different combinations of activating marks were associated with specific reprogramming factors; there was an order of acquisition of chromatin marks at pluripotency loci; and multivalent states, comprising previously undetermined combinations of activating and repressive histone modifications were enriched for CTCF. In the hematopoietic system we defined critical decision points in the lineage tree; identified regulatory elements that were enriched in cell-type specific regions and found that the underlying chromatin state was achieved by specific erasure of pre-existing chromatin marks in the precursor cell or by de novo assembly. Our method provides a systematic approach to model the dynamics of chromatin state to provide novel insights into the relationships among cell types in diverse cell-fate specification processes.},

SCLC is strongly associated with exposure to tobacco carcinogens. Most patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, with only one-third having earlier-stage disease that is amenable to potentially curative multimodality therapy. Genomic profiling of SCLC reveals extensive chromosomal rearrangements and a high mutation burden, almost always including functional inactivation of the tumour suppressor genes TP53 and RB1. Analyses of both human SCLC and murine models have defined subtypes of disease based on the relative expression of dominant transcriptional regulators and have also revealed substantial intratumoural heterogeneity. Aspects of this heterogeneity have been implicated in tumour evolution, metastasis and acquired therapeutic resistance. Although clinical progress in SCLC treatment has been notoriously slow, a better understanding of the biology of disease has uncovered novel vulnerabilities that might be amenable to targeted therapeutic approaches. The recent introduction of immune checkpoint blockade into the treatment of patients with SCLC is offering new hope, with a small subset of patients deriving prolonged benefit. Strategies to direct targeted therapies to those patients who are most likely to respond and to extend the durable benefit of effective antitumour immunity to a greater fraction of patients are urgently needed and are now being actively explored.},

Exit from pluripotency and priming for differentiation into somatic lineages is associated with genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. We show that during this phase, co-expression of enzymes required for DNA methylation turnover, DNMT3s and TETs, promotes cell-to-cell variability in this epigenetic mark. Using a combination of single-cell sequencing and quantitative biophysical modelling, we show that this variability is associated with coherent, genome-scale, oscillations in DNA methylation with an amplitude dependent on CpG density. Analysis of parallel single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic profiling provides evidence for oscillatory dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. These observations provide fresh insights into the emergence of epigenetic heterogeneity during early embryo development, indicating that dynamic changes in DNA methylation might influence early cell fate decisions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The emergence of drug resistance limits the efficacy of targeted therapies in human tumors. The prevalent view is that resistance is a fait accompli: when treatment is initiated, cancers already contain drug-resistant mutant cells. Bacteria exposed to antibiotics transiently increase their mutation rates (adaptive mutability), thus improving the likelihood of survival. We investigated whether human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells likewise exploit adaptive mutability to evade therapeutic pressure. We found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/BRAF inhibition down-regulates mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination DNA-repair genes and concomitantly up-regulates error-prone polymerases in drug-tolerant (persister) cells. MMR proteins were also down-regulated in patient-derived xenografts and tumor specimens during therapy. EGFR/BRAF inhibition induced DNA damage, increased mutability, and triggered microsatellite instability. Thus, like unicellular organisms, tumor cells evade therapeutic pressures by enhancing mutability.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Genomic intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is common in cancers, but the extent of phenotypic ITH is uncertain because most subclonal mutations are passengers. Since tumor phenotypes are largely driven by epigenetics, methylomic analyses can provide insights into phenotypic ITH. Following this principle, we determined the extent of epigenetic ITH in 16 human colorectal tumors by comparing the methylomes from spatially separated regions in each tumor. Methylomes from opposite tumor sides were similar (Pearson correlation {$>$}0.95) with little evidence of ITH or stepwise selection during growth, suggesting that the epigenome of a sampled tumor largely reflects that of its founder cell. Epigenetic conservation was functional, with higher conservation at promoters and expressed genes compared to non-coding regions. Despite epigenomic conservation, RNA expression varied between individual tumor glands, indicating continued adaption during growth. Because many promoters and enhancers were unmethylated, continued adaptation may be due to phenotypic plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses identified that interferon signaling and antigen-processing and presenting pathways were strongly conserved during tumor growth, suggesting a mechanism for immune evasion. In summary, our findings suggest that epigenomes are preferentially conserved during tumor growth and that early tumor cells are poised for rapid growth, phenotypic adaptation, and immune evasion.},

  abstract = {Carcinogenesis and cancer progression are often modeled using population dynamics equations for a diverse somatic cell population undergoing mutations or other alterations that alter the fitness of a cell and its progeny. Usually it is then assumed, paralleling standard mathematical approaches to evolution, that such alterations are slow compared to selection, i.e., compared to subpopulation frequency changes induced by unequal subpopulation proliferation rates. However, the alterations can be rapid in some cases. For example, results in our lab on in vitro analogues of transformation and progression in carcinogenesis suggest there could be periods where rapid alterations triggered by horizontal intercellular transfer of genetic material occur and quickly result in marked changes of cell population structure.We here initiate a mathematical study of situations where alterations are rapid compared to selection. A classic selection-mutation formalism is generalized to obtain a "proliferation-alteration" system of ordinary differential equations, which we analyze using a rapid-alteration approximation. A system-theoretical estimate of the total-population net growth rate emerges. This rate characterizes the diverse, interacting cell population acting as a single system; it is a weighted average of subpopulation rates, the weights being components of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector for an ergodic Markov-process matrix that describes alterations by themselves. We give a detailed numerical example to illustrate the rapid-alteration approximation, suggest a possible interpretation of the fact that average aneuploidy during cancer progression often appears to be comparatively stable in time, and briefly discuss possible generalizations as well as weaknesses of our approach.},

Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes ``LSC-specific'' genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. Significance: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

  abstract = {k-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparisons. However, a single mutation will mutate k consecutive k-mers and make most k-mer-based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity, for example, spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches owing to the size of k. Here, we propose strobemers as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of two or more linked shorter k-mers, where the combination of linked k-mers is decided by a hash function. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence-matching tool StrobeMap and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios.},

Current approaches are mainly focused on searching for statistically enriched dots on a genome-wide map. However, given the availability of a wide variety of orthogonal data types such as ChIA-PET, GAM, SPRITE, and high-throughput imaging, a supervised learning approach could facilitate the discovery of a comprehensive set of chromatin interactions. Here we present Peakachu, a Random Forest classification framework that predicts chromatin loops from genome-wide contact maps. Compared with current enrichment-based approaches, Peakachu identified more meaningful short-range interactions. We show that our models perform well in different platforms such as Hi-C, Micro-C, and DNA SPRITE, across different sequencing depths, and across different species. We applied this framework to systematically predict chromatin loops in 56 Hi-C datasets, and the results are available at the 3D Genome Browser (www.3dgenome.org).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Current therapies offer limited disease control, and patients have a poor prognosis. Empiric use of targeted therapy, especially at progression, is increasingly practiced despite a paucity of data regarding temporal and therapy-driven genomic evolution in pHGGs. To study the genetic landscape of pHGGs at recurrence, we performed whole exome and methylation analyses on matched primary and recurrent pHGGs from 16 patients. Tumor mutational profiles identified three distinct subgroups. Group 1 (n\,=\,7) harbored known hotspot mutations in Histone 3 (H3) (K27M or G34V) or IDH1 (H3/IDH1 mutants) and co-occurring TP53 or ACVR1 mutations in tumor pairs across the disease course. Group 2 (n\,=\,7), H3/IDH1 wildtype tumor pairs, harbored novel mutations in chromatin modifiers (ZMYND11, EP300 n\,=\,2), all associated with TP53 alterations, or had BRAF V600E mutations (n\,=\,2) conserved across tumor pairs. Group 3 included 2 tumors with NF1 germline mutations. Pairs from primary and relapsed pHGG samples clustered within the same DNA methylation subgroup. ATRX mutations were clonal and retained in H3G34V and H3/IDH1 wildtype tumors, while different genetic alterations in this gene were observed at diagnosis and recurrence in IDH1 mutant tumors. Mutations in putative drug targets (EGFR, ERBB2, PDGFRA, PI3K) were not always shared between primary and recurrence samples, indicating evolution during progression. Our findings indicate that specific key driver mutations in pHGGs are conserved at recurrence and are prime targets for therapeutic development and clinical trials (e.g. H3 post-translational modifications, IDH1, BRAF V600E). Other actionable mutations are acquired or lost, indicating that re-biopsy at recurrence will provide better guidance for effective targeted therapy of pHGGs.},

In this proposal, the value of amino acid information is proportional to the molecular weight of amino acids with a proportional constant of about 1.96??1025 bits per kg. In addition to this, for the experimental estimations of the minimum energy dissipation in genetic logic operations, we present two postulates: (1) the energy Ei(i=1,2,...,20) of amino acids in the messages conveyed by proteins is proportional to the value of information, and (2) amino acids are distributed according to their energy Ei so the amino acid population in proteins follows a Boltzmann distribution. Specifically, in the genetic message carried by the DNA from the genomes of living organisms, we found that the minimum energy dissipation in genetic logic operations was close to kTLn(2) joules per bit. ?? 2005 Society for Mathematical Biology.

Boolean deductions could help us describe the gene evolution process. For instance, most of the reported mutations that confer drug resistance to the HIV protease gene correspond to deductions. What is more, in the human beta-globin gene a similar situation appears where most of the single codon mutations correspond to Boolean deductions from the respective wild-type codon. \textcopyright{} 2004 Society for Mathematical Biology.

  abstract = {Cytosine DNA methylation (CDM) is a stable epigenetic modification to the genome and a widespread regulatory process in living organisms that involves multicomponent molecular machines. Genome-wide cytosine methylation patterning participates in the epigenetic reprogramming of a cell, suggesting that the biological information contained within methylation positions may be amenable to decoding. Adaptation to a new cellular or organismal environment also implies the potential for genome-wide redistribution of CDM changes that will ensure the stability of DNA molecules. This raises the question of whether or not we would be able to sort out the regulatory methylation signals from the CDM background ("noise") induced by thermal fluctuations. Here, we propose a novel statistical and information thermodynamic description of the CDM changes to address the last question. The physical basis of our statistical mechanical model was evaluated in two respects: 1) the adherence to Landauer's principle, according to which molecular machines must dissipate a minimum energy {$\epsilon$} = kBT ln2 at each logic operation, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature and 2) whether or not the binary stretch of methylation marks on the DNA molecule comprise a language of sorts, properly constrained by thermodynamic principles. The study was performed for genome-wide methylation data from 152 ecotypes and 40 trans-generational variations of Arabidopsis thaliana and 93 human tissues. The DNA persistence length, a basic mechanical property altered by CDM, was estimated with values from 39 to 66.9 nm. Classical methylome analysis can be retrieved by applying information thermodynamic modelling, which is able to discriminate signal from noise. Our finding suggests that the CDM signal comprises a language scheme properly constrained by molecular thermodynamic principles, which is part of an epigenomic communication system that obeys the same thermodynamic rules as do current human communication systems.},

Environmental or occupational exposures to carcinogens, especially tobacco, are the main risk factors for bladder cancer. Most bladder cancers are diagnosed after patients present with macroscopic haematuria, and cases are confirmed after transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), which also serves as the first stage of treatment. Bladder cancer develops via two distinct pathways, giving rise to non-muscle-invasive papillary tumours and non-papillary (solid) muscle-invasive tumours. The two subtypes have unique pathological features and different molecular characteristics. Indeed, The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified genetic drivers of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) as well as subtypes of MIBC with distinct characteristics and therapeutic responses. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), intravesical therapies (primarily Bacillus Calmette\textendash Gu\'erin (BCG)) with maintenance are the main treatments to prevent recurrence and progression after initial TURBT; additional therapies are needed for those who do not respond to BCG. For localized MIBC, optimizing care and reducing morbidity following cystectomy are important goals. In metastatic disease, advances in our genetic understanding of bladder cancer and in immunotherapy are being translated into new therapies.},

Mutation rates are considered to be constant or externally regulated. If, however, we take into account that genomes also encode for enzymes that perform replication and error correction, then individual genomes not only have a specific replication rate (fitness), but also a specific mutation rate. This leads to the concept of a mutation landscape. We explore evolution on mutation landscapes. Localization in pure mutation landscapes is only possible under extremely restrictive conditions. Coupling of mutation landscapes and fitness landscapes leads to localization and hence adaptation and evolution. We analyse how mutation landscapes facilitate localization in fitness landscapes and vice versa. Finally, we show that for mutation landscapes, at equilibrium, with constant environment, there is not necessarily selection for the minimum mutation rate. Instead, the target of selection is an optimum distribution of mutation rates, a `mutational quasispecies'.},

  abstract = {It is now widely recognized that epigenetic events are important mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Epigenetic information in chromatin includes covalent modifications (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination) of core nucleosomal proteins (histones). A recent progress in the field of histone modifications and chromatin research has tremendously enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control of key physiological and pathological processes. Histone modifications and other epigenetic mechanisms appear to work together in establishing and maintaining gene activity states, thus regulating a wide range of cellular processes. Different histone modifications themselves act in a coordinated and orderly fashion to regulate cellular processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Interest in histone modifications has further grown over the last decade with the discovery and characterization of a large number of histone-modifying molecules and protein complexes. Alterations in the function of histone-modifying complexes are believed to disrupt the pattern and levels of histone marks and consequently deregulate the control of chromatin-based processes, ultimately leading to oncogenic transformation and the development of cancer. Consistent with this notion, aberrant patterns of histone modifications have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. In this chapter, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the establishment and maintenance of histone marks and how disruptions of these chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis. We also suggest how these advances may facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat human malignancies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Melanoma is a common cancer in the Western world with an increasing incidence. Sun exposure is still considered to be the major risk factor for melanoma. The prognosis of patients with malignant (advanced-stage) melanoma differs widely between countries, but public campaigns advocating early detection have led to significant reductions in mortality rates. As well as sun exposure, distinct genetic alterations have been identified as associated with melanoma. For example, families with melanoma who have germline mutations in CDKN2A are well known, whereas the vast majority of sporadic melanomas have mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which is the pathway with the highest oncogenic and therapeutic relevance for this disease. BRAF and NRAS mutations are typically found in cutaneous melanomas, whereas KIT mutations are predominantly observed in mucosal and acral melanomas. GNAQ and GNA11 mutations prevail in uveal melanomas. Additionally, the PI3K\textendash AKT\textendash PTEN pathway and the immune checkpoint pathways are important. The finding that programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and PDL2 are expressed by melanoma cells, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells led to the recent development of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)-specific antibodies (for example, nivolumab and pembrolizumab). Alongside other new drugs \textemdash{} namely, BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib) \textemdash{} these agents are very promising and have been shown to significantly improve prognosis for patients with advanced-stage metastatic disease. Early signs are apparent that these new treatment modalities are also improving long-term clinical benefit and the quality of life of patients.

Using microarray analysis, we investigated global changes in gene expression after 5-Aza-CdR treatment in AML. In the AML cell line OCI-AML2, Aza-CdR induced the expression of 81 out of 22 000 genes; 96 genes were downregulated ({$\geqslant$}2-fold change in expression). RT-PCR analysis of 10 randomly selected genes confirmed the changes of expression in AML cells. Similar results were obtained with primary AML and MDS cells after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR ex vivo and in vivo, respectively. In contrast, significantly fewer changes in gene expression and cytotoxicity were detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear and bone marrow cells or transformed epithelial cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR. Interestingly, only 50.6\% of the induced genes contain putative CpG islands in the 5{${'}$} region. To further investigate the significance of promoter methylation in the induced genes, we analyzed the actual methylation status of randomly selected 5-Aza-CdR-inducible genes. We detected hypermethylation exclusively in the 5{${'}$} region of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene. DNA methylation inversely correlated with MPO expression in newly diagnosed untreated AML patients (P{$\leqslant$}0.004). In contrast, all other analyzed 5-Aza-CdR-inducible genes revealed no CpG methylation in the promoter region, suggesting a methylation-independent effect of 5-Aza-CdR.},

Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.},

Thus, transgenerational epigenetic variation in DNA methylation may generate new allelic states that alter transcription, providing a mechanism for phenotypic diversity in the absence of genetic mutation. Spontaneous methylation rates that may affect phenotype in the plant Arabidopsis are higher than the mutation rate.

  abstract = {The human epigenome has been experimentally characterized by measurements of protein binding, chromatin acessibility, methylation, and histone modification in hundreds of cell types. The result is a huge compendium of data, consisting of thousands of measurements for every basepair in the human genome. These data are difficult to make sense of, not only for humans, but also for computational methods that aim to detect genes and other functional elements, predict gene expression, characterize polymorphisms, etc. To address this challenge, we propose a deep neural network tensor factorization method, Avocado, that compresses epigenomic data into a dense, information-rich representation of the human genome. We use data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium to demonstrate that this learned representation of the genome is broadly useful: first, by imputing epigenomic data more accurately than previous methods, and second, by showing that machine learning models that exploit this representation outperform those trained directly on epigenomic data on a variety of genomics tasks. These tasks include predicting gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions, and elements of 3D chromatin architecture. Our findings suggest the broad utility of Avocado's learned latent representation for computational genomics and epigenomics.},

  abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash 40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {$>$}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {$>$}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at {$\lessequivlnt$}5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

These deaminases have also been proposed to func-tion in DNA demethylation via deamination of either 5-methylcytosine (mC) or TET-oxidized mC bases (ox-mCs), which include 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. One specific family member, APOBEC3A (A3A), has been shown to readily deaminate mC, raising the prospect of broader activity on ox-mCs. To investigate this claim, we developed a novel assay that allows for parallel profiling of activity on all modified cytosines. Our steady-state kinetic analysis reveals that A3A dis-criminates against all ox-mCs by {$>$}3700-fold, arguing that ox-mC deamination does not contribute substan-tially to demethylation. A3A is, by contrast, highly proficient at C/mC deamination. Under conditions of excess enzyme, C/mC bases can be deaminated to completion in long DNA segments, regardless of sequence context. Interestingly, under limiting A3A, the sequence preferences observed with targeting unmodified cytosine are further exaggerated when deaminating mC. Our study informs how methyla-tion, oxidation, and deamination can interplay in the genome and suggests A3A's potential utility as a biotechnological tool to discriminate between cyto-sine modification states.},

The method builds on the observation that AID/APOBEC family DNA deaminase enzymes can potently discriminate between cytosine modification states and exploits the non-destructive nature of enzymatic, rather than chemical, deamination. ACE-seq yielded high-confidence 5hmC profiles with at least 1,000-fold less DNA input than conventional methods. Applying ACE-seq to generate a base-resolution map of 5hmC in tissue-derived cortical excitatory neurons, we found that 5hmC was almost entirely confined to CG dinucleotides. The whole-genome map permitted cytosine, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC to be parsed and revealed genomic features that diverged from global patterns, including enhancers and imprinting control regions with high and low 5hmC/5mC ratios, respectively. Enzymatic deamination overcomes many challenges posed by bisulfite-based methods, thus expanding the scope of epigenome profiling to include scarce samples and opening new lines of inquiry regarding the role of cytosine modifications in genome biology.},

  abstract = {I recently saw an old friend for the first time in many years. We had been Ph.D. students at the same time, both studying science, although in different areas. She later dropped out of graduate school, went to Harvard Law School and is now a senior lawyer for a major environmental organization. At some point, the conversation turned to why she had left graduate school. To my utter astonishment, she said it was because it made her feel stupid. After a couple of years of feeling stupid every day, she was ready to do something else. I had thought of her as one of the brightest people I knew and her subsequent career supports that view. What she said bothered me. I kept thinking about it; sometime the next day, it hit me. Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Let me explain. For almost all of us, one of the reasons that we liked science in high school and college is that we were good at it. That can't be the only reason \textendash{} fascination with understanding the physical world and an emotional need to discover new things has to enter into it too. But high-school and college science means taking courses, and doing well in courses means getting the right answers on tests. If you know those answers, you do well and get to feel smart. A Ph.D., in which you have to do a research project, is a whole different thing. For me, it was a daunting task. How could I possibly frame the questions that would lead to significant discoveries; design and interpret an experiment so that the conclusions were absolutely convincing; foresee difficulties and see ways around them, or, failing that, solve them when they occurred? My Ph.D. project was somewhat interdisciplinary and, for a while, whenever I ran into a problem, I pestered the faculty in my department who were experts in the various disciplines that I needed. I remember the day when Henry Taube (who won the Nobel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. Once I faced that fact, I solved the problem in a couple of days. (It wasn't really very hard; I just had to try a few things.) The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. I'd like to suggest that our Ph.D. programs often do students a disservice in two ways. First, I don't think students are made to understand how hard it is to do research. And how very, very hard it is to do important research. It's a lot harder than taking even very demanding courses. What makes it difficult is that research is immersion in the unknown. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right question or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Admittedly, science is made harder by competition for grants and space in top journals. But apart from all of that, doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. Second, we don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid \textendash{} that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. I'm not talking about 'relative stupidity', in which the other students in the class actually read the material, think about it and ace the exam, whereas you don't. I'm also not talking about bright people who might be working in areas that don't match their talents. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity'. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, 'I don't know'. The point of the exam isn't to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it's the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student's weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student's knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time. No doubt, this can be difficult for students who are accustomed to getting the answers right. No doubt, reasonable levels of confidence and emotional resilience help, but I think scientific education might do more to ease what is a very big transition: from learning what other people once discovered to making your own discoveries. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.},

To achieve this, the knowledge of its three-dimensional architecture is necessary. Advances in genomic technologies and the development of new analytical methods, such as Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and its derivatives, provide unprecedented insights in the spatial organization of genomes. Here we present TADbit, a computational framework to analyze and model the chromatin fiber in three dimensions. Our package takes as input the sequencing reads of 3C-based experiments and performs the following main tasks: (i) pre-process the reads, (ii) map the reads to a reference genome, (iii) filter and normalize the interaction data, (iv) analyze the resulting interaction matrices, (v) build 3D models of selected genomic domains, and (vi) analyze the resulting models to characterize their structural properties. To illustrate the use of TADbit, we automatically modeled 50 genomic domains from the fly genome revealing differential structural features of the previously defined chromatin colors, establishing a link between the conformation of the genome and the local chromatin composition. TADbit provides three-dimensional models built from 3C-based experiments, which are ready for visualization and for characterizing their relation to gene expression and epigenetic states.

Although several methods have been proposed, the most widely used type of normalization of Hi-C data usually casts estimation of unwanted effects as a matrix balancing problem, relying on the assumption that all genomic regions interact equally with each other. In order to explore the effect of copy-number variations on Hi-C data normalization, we first propose a simulation model that predict the effects of large copy-number changes on a diploid Hi-C contact map. We then show that the standard approaches relying on equal visibility fail to correct for unwanted effects in the presence of copy-number variations. We thus propose a simple extension to matrix balancing methods that model these effects. Our approach can either retain the copy-number variation effects (LOIC) or remove them (CAIC). We show that this leads to better downstream analysis of the three-dimensional organization of rearranged genomes. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of using dedicated methods for the analysis of Hi-C cancer data. Both CAIC and LOIC methods perform well on simulated and real Hi-C data sets, each fulfilling different needs.},

  abstract = {Domination in the stem cell world A Nobel Prize\textendash winning discovery showed that specialized cells can be genetically reprogrammed into stem cells, thus gaining the ability to become any cell type in the body. But what happens during reprogramming is not completely understood. Shakiba et al. used experimental and mathematical approaches to show that skin cells compete during reprogramming, eliminating one another as the population progresses toward the stem cell state (see the Perspective by Wolff and Purvis). The ``winners'' are a special class of skin cells originating from the neural crest. Cells of this type normally emerge during embryonic development and migrate into various tissues, including the skin, muscle, and nervous system. Science, this issue p. eaan0925; see also p. 330 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONRecent advances in lineage tracking using DNA-based barcoding technologies have provided new insights into the developmental dynamics of cell populations. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that govern these dynamics and their relation to clonal dominance remain unclear. Understanding the factors that determine the appearance and disappearance of individual clones and their derivatives in dynamic, heterogeneous systems has broad implications for normal and aberrant tissue development, providing a new lens with which to understand emergent behaviors in multicellular systems.The process of reprogramming, whereby somatic cells are converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through the overexpression of key transcription factors, serves as a tractable model to probe the connection between intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing cell population dynamics. The field of reprogramming has largely accepted the ``clonal equipotency'' paradigm, in which somatic cells have an equal potential to attain an iPSC state; however, it remains unclear whether inequalities between the fitness of reprogramming cells drive non-neutral clonal drift. RATIONALEThis study aimed to quantitatively explore the impact of competitive interactions in driving clonal dynamics within a reprogramming population. A cellular barcoding strategy, whereby heritable DNA tags are inserted into the genome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), was used to track the relative contribution of clonal derivatives to the reprogramming population. Mathematical modeling was used to decouple the effect of stochastic reprogramming latencies on clonal dynamics, enabling the identification of non-neutral clonal dominance. Finally, a mouse model was developed to trace the developmental origins of the heterogeneous MEF compartment and investigate the mechanism of cell fitness inequalities in reprogramming. RESULTSPopulation reprogramming promoted highly selective clonal dynamics, leading to the elimination of up to 80\% of clones after a week of reprogramming. Single-cell reprogramming studies, on the other hand, suggested that all MEF-derived clones had a propensity to reprogram when cultured in isolation. Furthermore, an elite subset of dominating clones was found to drive the dynamics and composition of the bulk reprogramming pool. Early dominating clones that emerged after a week of reprogramming exhibited a robust and predictable propensity to overtake the culture and contribute to the final successfully reprogrammed iPSC pool. Our modeling results reveal that neutral effects did not capture the evolution of clone size distributions. Indeed, parallel reprogramming cultures grown from a common pool of barcoded MEFs demonstrated a correlation in clonal outcomes, driven by a subset of reprogramming MEFs. This subset of MEFs exhibited an a priori propensity for reprogramming and dominance. Lineage tracing revealed that these MEFs arise during embryonic development from a Wnt1-expressing population associable with the neural crest compartment. CONCLUSIONThis study reveals cell competition as an important parameter that arises in the population context as a result of genetically encoded inequalities in cell fitness. Competition serves as a mechanism by which otherwise hidden cells with context-specific eliteness emerge to occupy and dominate the reprogramming niche. Given the propensity for a small subset of clones to overtake the population, it is likely that bulk measurements of the reprogramming process represent a biased view of the reprogramming trajectory. The findings of this study reveal that cell competition may be a generalizable and controllable parameter for understanding and controlling the dynamics of multicellular developmental and disease systems in a quantified manner. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6438/eaan0925/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Competition during reprogramming results in dominant clones derived from elite cells.(Top) During reprogramming, when MEFs transition to pluripotency, competition between cells leads to clonal selection and dominance. Numbered circles represent individual reprogramming clones; circle size indicates the relative abundance of cells derived from a clone in the overall population. (Bottom) Mathematical modeling reveals that clonal dynamics are not driven by stochastic reprogramming latencies, but rather by a subset of elite MEFs derived from the neural crest (NC) that have an enhanced a priori reprogramming propensity. The ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from differentiated cell types has enabled researchers to engineer cell states. Although studies have identified molecular networks that reprogram cells to pluripotency, the cellular dynamics of these processes remain poorly understood. Here, by combining cellular barcoding, mathematical modeling, and lineage tracing approaches, we demonstrate that reprogramming dynamics in heterogeneous populations are driven by dominant ``elite'' clones. Clones arise a priori from a population of poised mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Wnt1-expressing cells that may represent a neural crest\textendash derived population. This work highlights the importance of cellular dynamics in fate programming outcomes and uncovers cell competition as a mechanism by which cells with eliteness emerge to occupy and dominate the reprogramming niche. During reprogramming, specific cells display ``eliteness'' and emerge to dominate the reprogramming niche.

Epigenetic instable iPSCs with aberrant DNA methylation may divide and differentiate into cancer cells. Unfortunately, little effort has been taken to compare the epigenetic variation in iPSCs with that in differentiated cells. Here, we developed an analytical procedure to decipher the DNA methylation heterogeneity of mixed cells and further exploited it to quantitatively assess the DNA methylation variation in the methylomes of adipose-derived stem cells (ADS), mature adipocytes differentiated from ADS cells (ADS-adipose) and iPSCs reprogrammed from ADS cells (ADS-iPSCs).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS:We observed that the degree of DNA methylation variation varies across distinct genomic regions with promoter and 5'UTR regions exhibiting low methylation variation and Satellite showing high methylation variation. Compared with differentiated cells, ADS-iPSCs possess globally decreased methylation variation, in particular in repetitive elements. Interestingly, DNA methylation variation decreases in promoter regions during differentiation but increases during reprogramming. Methylation variation in promoter regions is negatively correlated with gene expression. In addition, genes showing a bipolar methylation pattern, with both completely methylated and completely unmethylated reads, are related to the carbohydrate metabolic process, cellular development, cellular growth, proliferation, etc.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS:This study delivers a way to detect cell-subset specific methylation genes in a mixed cell population and provides a better understanding of methylation dynamics during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming.},

Here, we present a simple and effective method, MAnorm, for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets describing transcription factor binding sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding differences inferred by MAnorm showed strong correlation with both the changes in expression of target genes and the binding of cell type-specific regulators.},

  abstract = {Research integrity is frequently highlighted as an essential component of modern medicine and science. Adherence to the ethical principles of one's profession might seem like a simple task, but research misconduct remains a serious problem. Despite repeated calls for increased emphasis on the importance of research integrity [1\textendash 6] and a proliferation of guidelines regu-lating scientific misconduct at the international, national, and institutional levels [7,8], recent scandals concerning falsification and suppression of results [9,10] suggest that we need to more carefully nurture the ethical integrity of our research endeavours. Most of the recent controversy concerning scientific misconduct has focused on plagiarism and fabrication of results. This type of malpractice has rightly been universally recognized as a very serious breach of research integrity. However, the focus on these abuses has distracted attention away from other practices which, while they may not jeopardize the scientific process to the same extent, are nonetheless clearly breaches of scientific integrity. Much more could be done to combat authorship misattribution, failure to declare relevant conflicts of interest (COIs), failure to report results, and misuse of metrics in funding decisions\textemdash in terms of both establishing stronger guidelines and ensuring their enforcement. Although many institutions have official integrity guidelines, these frequently act as a win-dow dressing\textemdash claiming to address key integrity issues while allowing corrosive low-level mis-conduct to proliferate. For example, putting pressure on junior researchers to allow guest authors on papers is not only unethical but also makes it more likely that they will see such behaviour as acceptable. Here, we suggest ten simple rules that should be put into action by all research institutions and to which all researchers should adhere in order to ensure ethical behaviour in science and medicine. In our view, all integrity guidelines should mandate these minimum requirements. Rules 1\textendash 5 are specific recommendations for particular integrity issues, and Rules 6\textendash 10 concern what institutions themselves should do.},

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in gene regulation and the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) is enthralling for many disease studies. There are several aspects that we can improve over existing DMR detection methods: (i) methylation statuses of nearby CpG sites are highly correlated, but this fact has seldom been modelled rigorously due to the uneven spacing; (ii) it is practically important to be able to handle both paired and unpaired samples; and (iii) the capability to detect DMRs from a single pair of samples is demanded. Results: We present DMRMark (DMR detection based on non-homogeneous hidden Markov model), a novel Bayesian framework for detecting DMRs from methylation array data. It combines the constrained Gaussian mixture model that incorporates the biological knowledge with the non-homogeneous hidden Markov model that models spatial correlation. Unlike existing methods, our DMR detection is achieved without predefined boundaries or decision windows. Furthermore, our method can detect DMRs from a single pair of samples and can also incorporate unpaired samples. Both simulation studies and real datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed the significant improvement of DMRMark over other methods. Availability and implementation: DMRMark is freely available as an R package at the CRAN R package repository. Contact: xfan@cuhk.edu.hk. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

RECENT FINDINGS Epigenetics is the study of mitotically heritable alterations in gene expression potential that are not mediated by changes in DNA sequence. Recently, it has become clear that nutrition can affect epigenetic mechanisms, causing long-term changes in gene expression. This review focuses on methods for studying the epigenetic mechanism DNA methylation. Recent advances include improvement in high-throughput methods to obtain quantitative data on locus-specific DNA methylation and development of various approaches to study DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale. SUMMARY No single method of DNA methylation analysis will be appropriate for every application. By understanding the type of information provided by, and the inherent potential for bias and artifact associated with, each method, investigators can select the method most appropriate for their specific research needs.},

Such a molecular clock approach is currently impractical because somatic mutations are rare, but more feasible measurements are possible by substituting instead the 5' to 3' order of epigenetic modifications such as CpG methylation. Epigenetic somatic errors are readily detected as age-related changes in methylation, which suggests certain adult stem cells divide frequently and "compete" for survival within niches. Potentially the genealogy of any human cell may be reconstructed without prior experimental manipulation by merely reading histories recorded in their genomes.},

These therapeutic benefits were associated with restoration of leukemic cell differentiation, and the normalization of hematopoiesis was derived from mutant cells. By contrast, combining AG-221 or 5-azacytidine with FLT3 inhibition resulted in a reduction in mutant allele burden, progressive recovery of normal hematopoiesis from non-mutant stem-progenitor cells, and reversal of dysregulated DNA methylation and transcriptional output. Together, our studies suggest combined targeting of signaling and epigenetic pathways can increase therapeutic response in AML.Significance:AMLs with mutations inTET2orIDH2are sensitive to epigenetic therapy through inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity by 5-azacytidine or inhibition of mutant IDH2 through AG-221.

Single-nucleosome imaging in living mammalian cells has revealed subdiffusively dynamic nucleosome movement. It is unclear how single nucleosomes within CDs fluctuate and how the CD structure reflects the nucleosome movement. Here, we present a polymer model wherein CDs are characterized by fractal dimensions and the nucleosome fibers fluctuate in a viscoelastic medium with memory. We analytically show that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of nucleosome fluctuations within CDs is subdiffusive. The diffusion coefficient and the subdiffusive exponent depend on the structural information of CDs. This analytical result enabled us to extract information from the single-nucleosome imaging data for HeLa cells. Our observation that the MSD is lower at the nuclear periphery region than the interior region indicates that CDs in the heterochromatin-rich nuclear periphery region are more compact than those in the euchromatin-rich interior region with respect to the fractal dimensions as well as the size. Finally, we evaluated that the average size of CDs is in the range of 100\textendash 500 nm and that the relaxation time of nucleosome movement within CDs is a few seconds. Our results provide physical and dynamic insights into the genome architecture in living cells.},

Although methylation mainly occurs on the cytosine in a CG site, non-CG methylation is prevalent in pluripotent stem cells, brain, and oocytes. We previously identified non-CG methylation in several CG-rich regions in mouse germinal vesicle oocytes (GVOs), but the overall distribution of non-CG methylation and the enzymes responsible for this modification are unknown. Using amplification-free whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which can be used with minute amounts of DNA, we constructed the base-resolution methylome maps of GVOs, non-growing oocytes (NGOs), and mutant GVOs lacking the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt3L. We found that nearly two-thirds of all methylcytosines occur in a non-CG context in GVOs. The distribution of non-CG methylation closely resembled that of CG methylation throughout the genome and showed clear enrichment in gene bodies. Compared to NGOs, GVOs were over four times more methylated at non-CG sites, indicating that non-CG methylation accumulates during oocyte growth. Lack of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3L resulted in a global reduction in both CG and non-CG methylation, showing that non-CG methylation depends on the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L complex. Dnmt3b was dispensable. Of note, lack of Dnmt1 resulted in a slight decrease in CG methylation, suggesting that this maintenance enzyme plays a role in non-dividing oocytes. Dnmt1 may act on CG sites that remain hemimethylated in the de novo methylation process. Our results provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms and significance of non-CG methylation in mammalian oocytes.},

  abstract = {Despite signi cant advances in the study of cancer and associated combination therapeutic treatments, cancer still remains one of the most common and complex often-terminal diseases. Acquisition of high\{throughput experimental data from diverse cellular perspectives has thrown light on some of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. However, in general there is a lack of a general pattern and coherent model which can explain the development and evolution of the disease. To this end, evolutionary dynamics has been used, as a mathematical tool, in numerous studies to model various aspects of cancer over time periods. Our main focus in this thesis is on the use of stochastic and statistic methods to study cellular interactions within cancer tissues in order to understand the role of spatial structure, heterogeneity, and the microenvironment in cancer development. By constructing multi-cellular structures and using both analytic calculations and stochastic simulations, we have investigated the phenotypic hierarchy of stem cells within a heterogeneous system and in the presence of environmentally induced plasticity. Moreover, the e ect of a random environment on the development of cancer has been explored in a general framework. As an important application of the multi-stage hierarchical model, the structure of the colonic/intestinal crypt has been taken into account to show the crucial role of these stem cells in the initiation and progression of colorectal/intestinal cancer. From an alternative viewpoint, we have envisaged the hierarchy of mutations as an evolutionary mechanism in the context of acute myeloid leukemia and carried out a statistical analysis of genetic data. Our  ndings in this thesis are general and most likely have many implications across a wide array of  elds including di erent blood and solid cancers, bacterial growth, drug resistance and social networks. Moreover, the introduced methods and analyses should have important applications in diverse branches of evolution, ecology, and population genetics.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the cell of origin, nature and biological consequences of initiating lesions, and order of subsequent mutations remain poorly understood, as AML is typically diagnosed without observation of a pre-leukaemic phase. Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3[A.sup.mut]) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3[A.sup.mut]-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3[A.sup.mut] arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance.},

  abstract = {In acute myeloid leukaemia, long-term survival is poor as most patients relapse despite achieving remission 1 . Historically, the failure of therapy has been thought to be due to mutations that produce drug resistance, possibly arising as a consequence of the mutagenic properties of chemotherapy drugs 2 . However, other lines of evidence have pointed to the pre-existence of drug-resistant cells 3 . For example, deep sequencing of paired diagnosis and relapse acute myeloid leukaemia samples has provided direct evidence that relapse in some cases is generated from minor genetic subclones present at diagnosis that survive chemotherapy 3\textendash 5 , suggesting that resistant cells are generated by evolutionary processes before treatment 3 and are selected by therapy 6\textendash 8 . Nevertheless, the mechanisms of therapy failure and capacity for leukaemic regeneration remain obscure, as sequence analysis alone does not provide insight into the cell types that are fated to drive relapse. Although leukaemia stem cells 9,10 have been linked to relapse owing to their dormancy and self-renewal properties 11\textendash 13 , and leukaemia stem cell gene expression signatures are highly predictive of therapy failure 14,15 , experimental studies have been primarily correlative 7 and a role for leukaemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia relapse has not been directly proved. Here, through combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identify therapy-resistant cells already present at diagnosis and two major patterns of relapse. In some cases, relapse originated from rare leukaemia stem cells with a haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell phenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from larger subclones of immunophenotypically committed leukaemia cells that retained strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, the shared functional and transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of relapse emphasize the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that target stemness to prevent relapse. To track clonal dynamics during leukaemia initiation and progres-sion, we used a combined genetic and functional approach. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 11 patients with acute mye-loid leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis and relapse were obtained from our biobank. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed (coverage \textasciitilde{} 50\texttimes ) on leukaemic blasts isolated from each sample (clinical and immunophenotypic data in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively). T cells purified from diagnosis samples were used as the germline reference and to identify ancestral pre-leukaemic mutations 16 . To evaluate the genetic diversity of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), diag-nosis and relapse samples were transplanted into NOD/SCID/IL-2Rg c -null (NSG) or NSG-SGM3 (humanized cytokine) mice 17 . Human myeloid (CD45 + CD33 +) and B-cell (CD45 + CD19 +) populations were sorted from xenografts and genotyped by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, sensitivity \textasciitilde{} 1 in 1,000) for a subset of the variants identified by WGS. Additionally, patient samples from diagnosis, relapse, and remission time points (where available) were sorted into four progenitor (CD33 - haematopoietic stem cells/multipotent progenitors (HSCs/MPPs), multi-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs), common myeloid progenitors/ megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (CMPs/MEPs), and granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMPs)) and four mature (CD45 dim CD33 + blasts, and T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells) populations using our established strategy 16 , and genotyped (5\textendash 20 variants per sample) by ddPCR (experimental design is outlined in Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate both the early stages of leukaemic development and the role of pre-leukaemic haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (preL-HSPC) as a potential source of relapse 16,18 , we identified somatic variants predicted to have a damaging effect on the encoded protein (protein-damaging variants, PDVs) (Supplementary Table 3). These were defined as pre-leukaemic (preL-PDV) if they were present in T cells sorted from patient samples, or in B cells sorted from xenografts, or leukaemic (L-PDV) if absent in these populations. Patients had an average of 22.3 {$\pm$} 14.6 PDVs and, remarkably, 30\textendash 50\% of these PDVs were pre-leukaemic (Fig. 1a). Cell populations carrying preL-PDVs but not L-PDVs were classified as pre-leukaemic, whereas those with both preL-PDVs and L-PDVs were considered leukaemic. We found evidence of a pre-leukaemic cell population in all patients except for number 9, who bore a KMT2A (also known as MLL) translocation; the lack of cells with pre-leukaemic mutations in this patient was consistent with previous reports of few cooperating mutations in MLL acute leukaemias 19,20},

  abstract = {DNA methylation studies have enabled researchers to understand methylation patterns and their regulatory roles in biological processes and disease. However, only a limited number of statistical approaches have been developed to provide formal quantitative analysis. Specifically, a few available methods do identify differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites or regions (DMR), but they suffer from limitations that arise mostly due to challenges inherent in bisulfite sequencing data. These challenges include: (1) that read-depths vary considerably among genomic positions and are often low; (2) both methylation and autocorrelation patterns change as regions change; and (3) CpG sites are distributed unevenly. Furthermore, there are several methodological limitations: almost none of these tools is capable of comparing multiple groups and/or working with missing values, and only a few allow continuous or multiple covariates. The last of these is of great interest among researchers, as the goal is often to find which regions of the genome are associated with several exposures and traits. To tackle these issues, we have developed an efficient DMC identification method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) called ``DMCHMM' which is a three-step approach (model selection, prediction, testing) aiming to address the aforementioned drawbacks. Our proposed method is different from other HMM methods since it profiles methylation of each sample separately, hence exploiting inter-CpG autocorrelation within samples, and it is more flexible than previous approaches by allowing multiple hidden states. Using simulations, we show that DMCHMM has the best performance among several competing methods. An analysis of cell-separated blood methylation profiles is also provided.

The force of selection can also be inferred from population diversity. If selection is strong and frequently eliminates less fit variants, diversity will be limited because new, initially homogeneous populations constantly emerge.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Here we translate a population genetics approach to human somatic cancer cell populations by measuring genomic diversity within and between small colorectal cancer (CRC) glands. Control tissue culture and xenograft experiments demonstrate that the population diversity of certain passenger DNA methylation patterns is reduced after cloning but subsequently increases with time. When measured in CRC gland populations, passenger methylation diversity from different parts of nine CRCs was relatively high and uniform, consistent with older, stable lineages rather than mixtures of younger homogeneous populations arising from frequent cycles of selection. The diversity of six metastases was also high, suggesting dissemination early after transformation. Diversity was lower in DNA mismatch repair deficient CRC glands, possibly suggesting more selection and the elimination of less fit variants when mutation rates are elevated.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The many hitchhiking passenger variants observed in primary and metastatic CRC cell populations are consistent with relatively old populations, suggesting that clonal evolution leading to selective sweeps may be rare after transformation. Selection in human cancers appears to be a weaker than presumed force after transformation, consistent with the observed rarity of driver mutations in cancer genomes. Phenotypic plasticity rather than the stepwise acquisition of new driver mutations may better account for the many different phenotypes within human tumors.},

To correlate physical with epigenetic pairwise distances, small 2,000- to 10,000-cell gland fragments were sampled from left and right sides of 12 primary colorectal cancers, and passenger methylation at 2 CpG-rich regions was measured by bisulfite sequencing. Methylation patterns were polymorphic but differences were similar between different parts of the same tumor, consistent with relatively isotropic or "flat" clonal expansions that could be simulated by rapid initial population expansions. Methylation patterns were too diverse to be consistent with very rare cancer stem cells but were more consistent with multiple ( approximately 4 to 1,000) long-lived cancer stem cell lineages per cancer gland. Our study illustrates the potential to reconstruct the unperturbed biology of human cancers from epigenetic passenger variations in their present-day genomes.},

Cancers are clonal populations and the billions of cancer cells present in a visible tumor are progeny of a single transformed cell. Therefore, human cancers can be represented by somatic cell ancestral trees that start from a single transformed cell and end with billions of present day cancer cells. We use a genealogical approach to infer tumor growth from somatic trees, employing haplotype DNA methylation pattern variation, or differences between specific CpG sites or "tags," in the cancer genome. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is copied, with error, during genome replication. At our tags, neutral copy errors in DNA methylation appear to occur at random, and much more frequently than sequence copy errors. To reconstruct a cancer tree, we sample and compare human colorectal genomes within small geographic regions (a cancer fragment), between fragments on the same side of the tumor, and between fragments from opposite tumor halves. The combined information on both physical distance and epigenetic distance informs our model for tumor ancestry. We use approximate Bayesian computation, a simulation-based method, to model tumor growth under a variety of evolutionary scenarios, estimating parameters that fit observed DNA methylation patterns. We conclude that methylation patterns sampled from human cancers are consistent with replication errors and certain simple cancer growth models. The inferred cancer trees are consistent with Gompertzian growth, a well-known cancer growth pattern.},

To test the prediction that clonal populations of histologically homogeneous cells should, therefore, have homogeneous methylation patterns, we studied methylation in leiomyomas. Despite the clonality and histological homogeneity of these solid tumors, we found that cells were heterogeneously methylated at a number of genomic sites. The heterogeneity was not caused by random methylation events within the leiomyomas because methylation patterns were similar in the core and periphery of a given tumor, and similar also among samples of independent leiomyomas and surrounding myometrial tissues extracted from a single uterus. Our results also showed that methylation of a site in the YNZ22 locus\textemdash in leiomyomas and in smooth muscle\textemdash was determined independently from the methylation of a neighboring site. Similar results were obtained for the IGH locus in colon and in several tumor tissues. These data indicate that methylation patterns are not identical in progeny cells, as current models suggest. Instead, it seems likely that methylation of a specific site reflects an equilibrium frequency defined by a continual loss and gain of methyl groups. Hence, the specificity found for the methylation of mammalian tissues is not achieved by strictly determining the methylation fate of individual cells, but by determining the overall methylation frequencies for individual sites.},

We found increased mRNA expression of MIA pathway substrates in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting this pathway in AML. Genetic and chemical inhibition of ALR reduces AML growth and viability, disrupts LSC self-renewal, and induces their differentiation. ALR inhibition preferentially decreases its substrate COX17, a mitochondrial copper chaperone, and knockdown of COX17 phenocopies ALR loss. Inhibiting ALR and COX17 increases mitochondrial copper levels which in turn inhibit S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and lower levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility to lower LSC viability. These results provide insight into mechanisms through which mitochondrial copper controls epigenetic status and viability of LSCs.},

  abstract = {Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and represents a high-grade neoplasm of skeletal myoblast-like cells. Decades of clinical and basic research have gradually improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of RMS and helped to optimize clinical care. The two major subtypes of RMS, originally characterized on the basis of light microscopic features, are driven by fundamentally different molecular mechanisms and pose distinct clinical challenges. Curative therapy depends on control of the primary tumour, which can arise at many distinct anatomical sites, as well as controlling disseminated disease that is known or assumed to be present in every case. Sophisticated risk stratification for children with RMS incorporates various clinical, pathological and molecular features, and that information is used to guide the application of multifaceted therapy. Such therapy has historically included cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as surgery, ionizing radiation or both. This Primer describes our current understanding of RMS epidemiology, disease susceptibility factors, disease mechanisms and elements of clinical care, including diagnostics, risk-based care of newly diagnosed and relapsed disease and the prevention and management of late effects in survivors. We also outline potential opportunities to further translate new biological insights into improved clinical outcomes.},

Condensin and cohesin structures, however, are different, and the DNA loops produced by each underlie distinct cell processes. Condensin rods compact chromosomes during mitosis, with condensin I and II complexes producing spatially defined and nested looping in metazoan cells. Structurally adaptive cohesin rings produce loops, which organize the genome during interphase. Cohesin-mediated loops, termed topologically associating domains or TADs, antagonize the formation of epigenetically defined but untethered DNA volumes, termed compartments. While condensin complexes formed through cis-interactions must maintain chromatin compaction throughout mitosis, cohesins remain highly dynamic during interphase to allow for transcription-mediated responses to external cues and the execution of developmental programs. Here, I review differences in condensin and cohesin structures, and highlight recent advances regarding the intramolecular or cis-based tetherings through which condensins compact DNA during mitosis and cohesins organize the genome during interphase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The discovery that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) can be oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins has prompted wide interest in the potential role of 5hmC in reshaping the mammalian DNA methylation landscape. The gold-standard bisulphite conversion technologies to study DNA methylation do not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC. However, new approaches to mapping 5hmC genome-wide have advanced rapidly, although it is unclear how the different methods compare in accurately calling 5hmC. In this study, we provide a comparative analysis on brain DNA using three 5hmC genome-wide approaches, namely whole-genome bisulphite/oxidative bisulphite sequencing (WG Bis/OxBis-seq), Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays coupled with oxidative bisulphite (HM450K Bis/OxBis) and antibody-based immunoprecipitation and sequencing of hydroxymethylated DNA (hMeDIP-seq). We also perform loci-specific TET-assisted bisulphite sequencing (TAB-seq) for validation of candidate regions. RESULTS We show that whole-genome single-base resolution approaches are advantaged in providing precise 5hmC values but require high sequencing depth to accurately measure 5hmC, as this modification is commonly in low abundance in mammalian cells. HM450K arrays coupled with oxidative bisulphite provide a cost-effective representation of 5hmC distribution, at CpG sites with 5hmC levels {$>\sptilde$}10\%. However, 5hmC analysis is restricted to the genomic location of the probes, which is an important consideration as 5hmC modification is commonly enriched at enhancer elements. Finally, we show that the widely used hMeDIP-seq method provides an efficient genome-wide profile of 5hmC and shows high correlation with WG Bis/OxBis-seq 5hmC distribution in brain DNA. However, in cell line DNA with low levels of 5hmC, hMeDIP-seq-enriched regions are not detected by WG Bis/OxBis or HM450K, either suggesting misinterpretation of 5hmC calls by hMeDIP or lack of sensitivity of the latter methods. CONCLUSIONS We highlight both the advantages and caveats of three commonly used genome-wide 5hmC profiling technologies and show that interpretation of 5hmC data can be significantly influenced by the sensitivity of methods used, especially as the levels of 5hmC are low and vary in different cell types and different genomic locations.},

Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci complementary to a short RNA guide. However, Cas9 can cleave off-target sites that are not fully complementary to the guide, which poses a major challenge for genome editing. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Using targeted deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome off-target analysis to assess Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage in human cells, we demonstrate that "enhanced specificity" SpCas9 (eSpCas9) variants reduce off-target effects and maintain robust on-target cleavage. Thus, eSpCas9 could be broadly useful for genome editing applications requiring a high level of specificity.},

This step is performed five times to maximize the number of tagged DNA strands and to generate multiple copies of each fragment. After cap-turing the tagged strands, a second adaptor is similarly integrated, and PCR amplification is performed with indexed primers. We performed scBS-seq on ovulated metaphase II oocytes (MIIs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured either in 2i medium or serum conditions. MIIs are an excellent model for technical assessment as they: (i) can be individually hand-picked to ensure that only one cell is processed; (ii) represent a highly homogeneous population, which allows discrimination between technical and biological variability; and (iii) present a distinct DNA methylome comprising large-scale hypermethylated and hypomethylated domains 8 . ESCs grown in serum conditions exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium characterized by transcrip-tional heterogeneity and stochastic switching of transcriptional states 9\textendash 12 , and emerging evidence from immunofluorescence and locus-specific studies suggests that 5mC heterogeneity exists in ESCs 13 . Recent studies have also demonstrated remarkable plas-ticity in the ESC methylome; genome-wide hypomethylation is induced by two kinase inhibitors (2i), which inhibit FGF signal-ing 13,14 . We used ESCs grown in serum ('serum ESCs') and ESCs grown in 2i medium ('2i ESCs') to determine whether scBS-seq can reveal DNA methylation heterogeneity in single cells. We sequenced 12 MII, 12 2i ESC, 20 serum ESC and 7 negative control scBS-seq libraries, and their bulk cell counterparts (pools of cells) on an Illumina HiSeq at relatively low sequencing depth (average 19.4 million 100-base-pair (bp) paired-end reads). On average, 3.9 million (M) reads (range, 1.5 M\textendash 14.3 M reads) were mapped, corresponding to an efficiency of 20.1\% (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1); this low efficiency is mostly due to the presence of low-complexity sequences (Supplementary Fig. 2). We obtained methylation scores on an average of 3.7 million CpG dinucleotides (CpGs; range, 1.8 M\textendash 7.7 M) corre sponding to 17.7\% of all CpGs (range, 8.5\textendash 36.2\%; Fig. 1b). More CpGs can be obtained with deeper sequencing, as the limiting duplication plateau was not reached at this sequencing depth (Supplementary Fig. 3). To validate this, we sequenced two MII libraries close to saturation and with longer sequencing reads (150 bp), which resulted in 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold more CpGs captured (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, because of the broad size distribution of fragments in scBS-seq libraries (Supplementary Fig. 1b), longer reads led to 9\% greater CpG coverage at saturat-ing sequencing depth and 16\% greater coverage at low depth. Integrating this additional sequencing revealed that up to 10.1 M CpGs (48.4\% of all CpGs) can be obtained by scBS-seq. We report a single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scbs-seq) method that can be used to accurately measure dna methylation at up to 48.4\% of cpG sites. embryonic stem cells grown in serum or in 2i medium displayed epigenetic heterogeneity, with '2i-like' cells present in serum culture. integration of 12 individual mouse oocyte datasets largely recapitulated the whole dna methylome, which makes scbs-seq a versatile tool to explore dna methylation in rare cells and heterogeneous populations. DNA methylation at cytosine residues (5mC) is an epigenetic mark that has critical roles in the regulation and maintenance of cell type\textendash specific transcriptional programs 1,2 . Our understanding of 5mC functionality has been revolutionized by the development of BS-seq, which offers single-cytosine resolution and absolute quantification of 5mC genome-wide. Recent advances have dem-onstrated the power of single-cell sequencing to deconvolve mixed cell populations 3\textendash 5 . Incorporating epigenetic information into this single-cell arsenal will transform our understanding of gene regulation and provide insights into epigenetic heterogeneity 6 . Here we report an accurate and reproducible method, scBS-seq, that allows assessment of 5mC heterogeneity in cell populations across the entire genome. In commonly used BS-seq protocols, sequencing adaptors are ligated to fragmented DNA before bisulfite conversion, which results in a loss of information owing to DNA degradation by the bisulfite treatment. To minimize DNA loss from single cells, we developed a modification of post-bisulfite adaptor tagging 7 . In scBS-seq, bisulfite treatment is performed first, which results in simultaneous DNA fragmentation and conversion of unmethylated cytosines to thymine (Fig. 1a). Then, synthesis of complementary strands is primed using oligonuleotides containing Illumina adaptor},

  abstract = {In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv(3)(q21;q26) or t(3;3)(q21;q26), a translocated GATA2 enhancer drives oncogenic expression of EVI1. We generated an EVI1-GFP AML model and applied an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 enhancer scan to uncover sequence motifs essential for EVI1 transcription. Using this approach, we pinpointed a single regulatory element in the translocated GATA2 enhancer that is critically required for aberrant EVI1 expression. This element contained a DNA-binding motif for the transcription factor MYB, which specifically occupied this site at the translocated allele and was dispensable for GATA2 expression. MYB knockout as well as peptidomimetic blockade of CBP/p300-dependent MYB functions resulted in downregulation of EVI1 but not of GATA2. Targeting MYB or mutating its DNA-binding motif within the GATA2 enhancer resulted in myeloid differentiation and cell death, suggesting that interference with MYB-driven EVI1 transcription provides a potential entry point for therapy of inv(3)/t(3;3) AMLs. Significance: We show a novel paradigm in which chromosomal aberrations reveal critical regulatory elements that are nonfunctional at their endogenous locus. This knowledge provides a rationale to develop new compounds to selectively interfere with oncogenic enhancer activity.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659},

  abstract = {The properties of the methyl-directed DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.37) suggest that it is the enzyme that maintains patterns of methylation in the human genome. Proposals for the enzyme's mechanism of action suggest that 5-methyldeoxycytidine is produced from deoxycytidine via a dihydrocytosine intermediate. We have used an oligodeoxynucleotide containing 5-fluorodeoxycytidine as a suicide substrate to capture the enzyme and the dihydrocytosine intermediate. Gel retardation experiments demonstrate the formation of the expected covalent complex between duplex DNA containing 5-fluorodeoxycytidine and the human enzyme. Formation of the complex was dependent upon the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting that it comprises an enzyme-linked 5-substituted dihydrocytosine moiety in DNA. Dihydrocytosine derivatives are extremely labile toward hydrolytic deamination in aqueous solution. Because C-to-T transition mutations are especially prevalent at CG sites in human DNA, we have used high-performance liquid chromatography to search for thymidine that might be generated by hydrolysis during the methyl transfer reaction. Despite the potential for deamination inherent in the formation of the intermediate, the methyltransferase did not produce detectable amounts of thymidine. The data suggest that the ability of the human methyltransferase to preserve genetic information when copying a methylation pattern (i.e., its fidelity) is comparable to the ability of a mammalian DNA polymerase to preserve genetic information when copying a DNA sequence. Thus the high frequency of C-to-T transitions at CG sites in human DNA does not appear to be due to the normal enzymatic maintenance of methylation patterns.},

As decitabine (DAC) is known to be effective also in AML/MDS with leukocytosis, we investigated the combination of DAC with DLIs for relapse after allo-HCT. Between 2006 and 2016, 26 patients (median age 59 years) with AML (n = 18), MDS (n = 6), or MPN (n = 2) and overt hematological relapse after allo-HCT were treated. Median duration from allo-HCT to relapse was 306 days (range, 76\textendash 4943). Eighteen patients received DAC + DLIs, 8 DAC-only (median number cycles of DAC: 2, range 1\textendash 13, median number of DLIs: 2, range 1\textendash 10). The incidence of acute and chronic GvHD in patients receiving DLI was 17\% (3/18) and 6\% (1/18), respectively. CR/CRi was achieved in 15\% (4/26), PR in 4\% (1/26), and stable disease in 58\% (15/26) of patients. Eight patients received a second allo-HCT. Median overall survival was 4.7 months. Elevated PD-L1 protein expression in bone marrow cells was detected in 4/8 patients with \textquestiondown 20\% blast infiltration prior to DAC, without a clear association with response. In conclusion, the DAC + DLI regimen proved feasible and effective in relapsed myeloid malignancies after allo-HCT, with efficacy not restricted to patients with low leukemic burden.},

This has led to the search for compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. However, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal instability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint pathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene addiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the regression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours that experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome instability recur at markedly elevated rates. The recurrent tumours are highly aneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early chromosomal instability may be responsible for tumour relapse after seemingly effective anticancer treatments.},

While many studies have focused on the first two components, the role of drift in cancer evolution has received little attention. Drift occurs when all individuals in the population have the same likelihood of producing surviving offspring, and so by definition a drifting population is one that is evolving neutrally. Here we focus on how neutral evolution is manifested in the cancer genome. We discuss how neutral passenger mutations provide a magnifying glass that reveals the evolutionary dynamics underpinning cancer development, and outline how statistical inference can be used to quantify these dynamics from sequencing data. We argue that only after we understand the impact of neutral drift on the genome can we begin to make full sense of clonal selection.

Accumulating evidence suggests that intratumor heterogeneity likely is the key to understanding treatment failure. However, the extent of intratumor heterogeneity as a result of tumor evolution is still poorly understood. To address this, we developed a unique surgical multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor fragments from 11 GB patients. We present an integrated genomic analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with most patients displaying different GB subtypes within the same tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in EGFR and CDKN2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in PDGFRA and PTEN as later events during cancer progression. We also characterized the clonal organization of each tumor fragment at the single-molecule level, detecting multiple coexisting cell lineages. Our results reveal the genome-wide architecture of intratumor variability in GB across multiple spatial scales and patient-specific patterns of cancer evolution, with consequences for treatment design.},

To date, the primary evidence for CSCs derives from transplantation assays, which have known limitations. In particular, they are unable to report on the fate of cells within the original human tumor. Because of the difficulty in measuring tumor characteristics in patients, cellular organization and other aspects of cancer dynamics have not been quantified directly, although they likely play a fundamental role in tumor progression and therapy response. As such, new approaches to study CSCs in patient-derived tumor specimens are needed. In this study, we exploited ultradeep single-molecule genomic data derived from multiple microdissected colorectal cancer glands per tumor, along with a novel quantitative approach to measure tumor characteristics, define patient-specific tumor profiles, and infer tumor ancestral trees. We show that each cancer is unique in terms of its cellular organization, molecular heterogeneity, time from malignant transformation, and rate of mutation and apoptosis. Importantly, we estimate CSC fractions between 0.5\% and 4\%, indicative of a hierarchical organization responsible for long-lived CSC lineages, with variable rates of symmetric cell division. We also observed extensive molecular heterogeneity, both between and within individual cancer glands, suggesting a complex hierarchy of mitotic clones. Our framework enables the measurement of clinically relevant patient-specific characteristics in vivo, providing insight into the cellular organization and dynamics of tumor growth, with implications for personalized patient care.},

It has often been noted that the Dirichlet assumption is approximate because positive correlations among alleles cannot be accommodated under the Dirichlet model. However, the validity of the Dirichlet distribution has never been systematically investigated in a general framework. This paper attempts to address this problem by providing a general overview of how allele fraction data under the most common multi-allelic mutational structures should be modeled. The Dirichlet and alternative models are investigated by simulating allele fractions from a diffusion approximation of the multi-allelic Wright\textendash Fisher process with mutation, and applying a moment-based analysis method. The study shows that the optimal modeling strategy for the distribution of allele fractions depends on the specific mutation process. The Dirichlet model is only an exceptionally good approximation for the pure drift, Jukes\textendash Cantor and parent-independent mutation processes with small mutation rates. Alternative models are required and proposed for the other mutation processes, such as a Beta\textendash Dirichlet model for the infinite alleles mutation process, and a Hierarchical Beta model for the Kimura, Hasegawa\textendash Kishino\textendash Yano and Tamura\textendash Nei processes. Finally, a novel Hierarchical Beta approximation is developed, a Pyramidal Hierarchical Beta model, for the generalized time-reversible and single-step mutation processes.},

However, this deterministic view of development contrasts with recent genomic studies that suggest that the multiple steps of transcription are by themselves rather leaky.Although any single transcription factor (TF) can typically bind to thousands of sites throughout the genome, cis-regulatory activity at enhancers requires the concerted action of multiple binding events (which can be homotypic or heterotypic).TFs bind to enhancers in a combinatorial manner, which is facilitated through direct and indirect cooperative mechanisms. The combinatorial nature of enhancer occupancy allows genes to be regulated in complex patterns in both space and time.DNA and proteins can act together as a scaffold to cooperatively recruit TFs to enhancers.Enhancers undergo progressive changes during development, in which their occupancy by TFs, and the position of nucleosomes with or without post-translational modifications, reflect their inactive, poised or active state.Pioneer TFs recruit chromatin-remodelling factors to reposition nucleosomes, thus facilitating the occupancy of other TFs at subsequent developmental stages.Enhancer priming can occur through many different mechanisms. For example, some TF binding events may serve as placeholders to prevent nucleosome repositioning.Partially redundant enhancers can act to buffer changes in environmental conditions to ensure robust developmental progression.Multiple elements regulating the same gene seem to assemble in a three-dimensional structure with the promoter, and can have synergistic or repressive influences on each other.},

Introduction of biology-driven approaches to risk stratification and new drug development has been slower in WT than in other childhood tumours. Current prognostic classification for children with WT is grounded in clinical and pathological findings and in dedicated protocols on molecular alterations. Treatment includes conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery, and radiation therapy in some cases. Advanced imaging to capture tumour composition, optimizing irradiation techniques to reduce target volumes, and evaluation of newer surgical procedures are key areas for future research.},

High-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies capture the structure of the chromatin on a global scale by measuring all-vs.-all interactions and can provide new insights into genomic regulation. The workflow presented here describes how to analyze and interpret a comparative Hi-C experiment. We describe the process of obtaining Hi-C data from public repositories and give suggestions for pre-processing pipelines for users who intend to analyze their own raw data. We then describe the data normalization and comparative analysis process. We present three protocols describing the use of the multiHiCcompare, diffHic, and FIND R packages, respectively, to perform a comparative analysis of Hi-C experiments. Finally, visualization of the results and downstream interpretation of the differentially interacting regions are discussed. The bulk of this tutorial uses the R programming environment, and the processes described can be performed with most operating systems and a single computer. \textcopyright{} 2019 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

To date, only snapshots of different mouse and human cell types have been generated, providing a static view on DNA methylation. To enable monitoring of methylation status as it changes over time, we establish a reporter of genomic methylation (RGM) that relies on a minimal imprinted gene promoter driving a fluorescent protein. We show that insertion of RGM proximal to promoter-associated CpG islands reports the gain or loss of DNA methylation. We further utilized RGM to report endogenous methylation dynamics of non-coding regulatory elements, such as the pluripotency-specific super enhancers of Sox2 and miR290. Loci-specific DNA methylation changes and their correlation with transcription were visualized during cell-state transition following differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and during reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. RGM will allow the investigation of dynamic methylation changes during development and disease at single-cell resolution.},

Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity.},

However, most sequencing methods cannot elucidate this organization at the nucleotide level. Stergachis et al. present an approach, Fiber-seq, that maps chromatin fibers onto the underlying DNA template using methyltransferases to create a kind of stencil in fly and human cells. This method identifies chromatin structure at nearly a single-molecule level and can monitor the position of nucleosomes. Using Fiber-seq, the authors identify how regulatory DNA activation is related to nucleosome positioning and DNA variation. Science, this issue p. 1449 Gene regulation is chiefly determined at the level of individual linear chromatin molecules, yet our current understanding of cis-regulatory architectures derives from fragmented sampling of large numbers of disparate molecules. We developed an approach for precisely stenciling the structure of individual chromatin fibers onto their composite DNA templates using nonspecific DNA N6-adenine methyltransferases. Single-molecule long-read sequencing of chromatin stencils enabled nucleotide-resolution readout of the primary architecture of multikilobase chromatin fibers (Fiber-seq). Fiber-seq exposed widespread plasticity in the linear organization of individual chromatin fibers and illuminated principles guiding regulatory DNA actuation, the coordinated actuation of neighboring regulatory elements, single-molecule nucleosome positioning, and single-molecule transcription factor occupancy. Our approach and results open new vistas on the primary architecture of gene regulation. Fiber-seq translates single-molecule chromatin stencils into a readout of the primary architecture of chromatin.

In mammals, CTCF and the cohesin complex create submegabase structures with elevated internal chromatin contact frequencies, called topologically associating domains (TADs)8\textendash 12. Although TADs can contribute to transcriptional regulation, ablation of TAD organization by disrupting CTCF or the cohesin complex causes modest gene expression changes13\textendash 16. In contrast, CTCF is required for cell cycle regulation17, embryonic development and formation of various adult cell types18. To uncouple the role of CTCF in cell-state transitions and cell proliferation, we studied the effect of CTCF depletion during the conversion of human leukemic B cells into macrophages with minimal cell division. CTCF depletion disrupts TAD organization but not cell transdifferentiation. In contrast, CTCF depletion in induced macrophages impairs the full-blown upregulation of inflammatory genes after exposure to endotoxin. Our results demonstrate that CTCF-dependent genome topology is not strictly required for a functional cell-fate conversion but facilitates a rapid and efficient response to an external stimulus.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in gene expression, cellular differentiation, and disease. There is a complex interplay between the different layers of epigenetic information, including DNA methylation, nucleosome positions, histone modifications, histone variants, and other important epigenetic regulators. The different modifications do not act independently of each other and their relationship plays an important role in governing the regulation of the epigenome. Of these, DNA methylation is the best-studied epigenetic modification in mammals. However, the direct relationship between DNA methylation and chromatin modifications has been difficult to unravel with existing technologies, with epigenome-wide integration studies still based on ``overlaying'' independent chromatin modification and DNA methylation maps. Bisulphite sequencing enables the methylation state of every cytosine residue to be analyzed across a given molecule in a strand-specific context. Here, we describe a direct approach to interrogating the DNA methylation status of specific chromatin-marked DNA, using high-throughput sequencing of bisulphitetreated chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA (BisChIP-seq). This combined approach enables the exquisite relationship between chromatin-modified DNA or transcription factor-associated DNA and the methylation state of each targeted allele to be directly interrogated. BisChIP-Seq can now be widely applied genome-wide to further understand the molecular relationship between DNA methylation and other important epigenetic regulators.},

After revisiting how classical approaches have addressed this question in the past, we discuss the current state of epigenomic profiling and how functional information can be indirectly inferred. We also present new approaches that promise definitive functional answers, which are collectively referred to as 'epigenome editing'. In particular, we explore CRISPR-based technologies for single-locus and multi-locus manipulation. Finally, we discuss which level of function can be achieved with each approach and introduce emerging strategies for high-throughput progression from profiles to function.},

We developed a classifier based on measures of between-region subclonal genetic divergence and projected patient data into model space, finding different modes of evolution both within and between solid tumor types. Our findings have broad implications for how human tumors progress, how they accumulate intratumoral heterogeneity, and ultimately how they may be more effectively treated.},

In this method, sodium bisulphite is used to convert cytosine residues to uracil residues in single-stranded DNA, under conditions whereby 5-methylcytosine remains non-reactive. The converted DNA is amplified with specific primers and sequenced. All the cytosine residues remaining in the sequence represent previously methylated cytosines in the genome.

The digital nature of DNA methylation, present or absent on each allele, makes this assay capable of quantifying events in subpopulations of cells, whereas genome-wide chromatin studies lack the same quantitative capacity. Testing DNA methylation throughout the genome is possible using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but the high costs associated with the assay have made it impractical for studies involving more than limited numbers of samples. We have optimized a new transposase-based library preparation assay for the Illumina HiSeq X platform suitable for limited amounts of DNA and providing a major cost reduction for WGBS. By incorporating methylated cytosines during fragment end repair, we reveal an end-repair artifact affecting 1\%\textendash 2\% of reads that we can remove analytically. We show that the use of a high (G + C) content spike-in performs better than PhiX in terms of bisulfite sequencing quality. As expected, the loci with transposase-accessible chromatin are DNA hypomethylated and enriched in flanking regions by post-translational modifications of histones usually associated with positive effects on gene expression. Using these transposase-accessible loci to represent the cis-regulatory loci in the genome, we compared the representation of these loci between WGBS and other genome-wide DNA methylation assays, showing WGBS to outperform substantially all of the alternatives. We conclude that it is now technologically and financially feasible to perform WGBS in larger numbers of samples with greater accuracy than previously possible.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The allocation of a sequencing budget when designing single cell RNA-seq experiments requires consideration of the tradeoff between number of cells sequenced and the read depth per cell. One approach to the problem is to perform a power analysis for a univariate objective such as differential expression. However, many of the goals of single-cell analysis requires consideration of the multivariate structure of gene expression, such as clustering. We introduce an approach to quantifying the impact of sequencing depth and cell number on the estimation of a multivariate generative model for gene expression that is based on error analysis in the framework of a variational autoencoder. We find that at shallow depths, the marginal benefit of deeper sequencing per cell significantly outweighs the benefit of increased cell numbers. Above about 15,000 reads per cell the benefit of increased sequencing depth is minor.

However, it has been difficult to determine the relationship between local chromatin fiber compaction and transcription in cells. Further, global changes in fiber diameters have not been observed, even between interphase and mitotic chromosomes. We show that an increase in the range of local inter-nucleosomal contacts in quiescent yeast drives the compaction of chromatin fibers genome-wide. Unlike actively dividing cells, inter-nucleosomal interactions in quiescent cells require a basic patch in the histone H4 tail. This quiescence-specific fiber folding globally represses transcription and inhibits chromatin loop extrusion by condensin. These results reveal that global changes in chromatin fiber compaction can occur during cell state transitions, and establish physiological roles for local chromatin fiber folding in regulating transcription and chromatin domain formation.},

However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population analysis by using super-resolution microscopy. TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells, yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells. The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation. Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms: cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts. Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin, whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the folding of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional chromatin state underpins the structural and functional basis of the genome by bringing regulatory elements and genes into close spatial proximity to ensure proper, cell-type\textendash specific gene expression profiles. Here, we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate how three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the context of copy-number variation, long-range epigenetic remodeling, and atypical gene expression programs in prostate cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the ability to segment their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs); however, these domains are generally smaller due to establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly, a large proportion of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries occur at regions that display copy-number variation. Notably, a common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer spanning the TP53 tumor suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is also accompanied by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions within the TADs that are enriched at regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators, and associated with alterations in gene expression. We also show that differential chromatin interactions across regulatory regions occur within long-range epigenetically activated or silenced regions of concordant gene activation or repression in prostate cancer. Finally, we present a novel visualization tool that enables integrated exploration of Hi-C interaction data, the transcriptome, and epigenome. This study provides new insights into the relationship between long-range epigenetic and genomic dysregulation and changes in higher-order chromatin interactions in cancer.},

Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion ({$>$}100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

  abstract = {Restriction landmark genome scanning (RLGS) is a 2-DE of genomic DNA, which visualizes thousands of loci. In a conventional RLGS method for methylation analysis, we have used a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, Notl as a landmark. However, it was unable to discriminate methylation polymorphism from sequence polymorphism. Here, we report an improved RLGS method to detect methylated sites directly. We employed isoschizomers, Mspl and Hpall, that recognize the same sequence (CCGG) but have different methylation sensitivity. We carried out the RLGS analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia, and obtained a pair of spot patterns with Mspl and Hpall. We detected 22 spots in both patterns. In comparison of them, 18\% of the spots were polymorphic, which indicated the methylation of C 5m CGG sites. Further analyses revealed an additional methylated site of Notl. Moreover, 52 and 54 restriction enzyme sites were also analyzed in two other ecotypes, Wassilewskija and Landsberg erecta, respectively. Consequently, 15\% of the 52 common sites showed methylation polymorphism among the three ecotypes. The restriction sites analyzed in this study were located in or near genes, and contribute new data about the correlation between methylation status and gene expression. Therefore, this result strongly indicates that the improved RLGS method is readily applicable to practical analyses of methylation dynamics, and provides clues to the relationship between methylation and gene expression. \textcopyright{} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Here we report that 5-hmC is an epigenetic hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. A member of the ten\textendash eleven translocation (TET) proteins, which catalyse the oxidation of methylated cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC, TET2, is repressed by androgens in PCa. Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated induction of the miR-29 family, which targets TET2, are markedly enhanced in hormone refractory PCa (HRPC) and its high expression predicts poor outcome of PCa patients. Furthermore, decreased expression of miR-29b results in reduced tumour growth and increased TET2 expression in an animal model of HRPC. Interestingly, global 5-hmC modification regulated by miR-29b represses FOXA1 activity. A reduction in 5-hmC activates PCa-related key pathways such as mTOR and AR. Thus, DNA modification directly links the TET2-dependent epigenetic pathway regulated by AR to 5-hmC-mediated tumour progression.},

However, for datasets in which the biologically relevant differences between cells are subtle, identifying these genes is challenging. We present the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm, an iterative soft feature selection strategy to quantify gene relevance and improve dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods with experimental validation in identifying novel stem cell populations of Schistosoma mansoni, a prevalent parasite that infects hundreds of millions of people. Extending our analysis to a total of 56 datasets, we show that SAM is generalizable and consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of biological and quantitative benchmarks.},

Next, building upon the differential enrichment of closed and open chromatin, we devised a method, Chromatin Velocity, that identifies the trajectories of epigenetic modifications at the single-cell level.

DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) as it can be detected from limited starting material. Infinium 450K methylation array is the most popular platform for high-throughput profiling of this mark in clinical samples, as it is cost-effective and requires small amounts of DNA. However, this method suffers from low genome coverage and errors introduced by probe cross-hybridization. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing can overcome these limitations but elevates the costs tremendously. Methyl-Capture Sequencing (MC Seq) is an attractive intermediate solution to increase the methylome coverage in large sample sets. Here we first demonstrate that MC Seq can be employed using DNA amounts comparable to the amounts used for Infinium 450K. Second, to provide guidance when choosing between the 2 platforms for EWAS, we evaluate and compare MC Seq and Infinium 450K in terms of coverage, technical variation, and concordance of methylation calls in clinical samples. Last, since the focus in EWAS is to study interindividual variation, we demonstrate the utility of MC Seq in studying interindividual variation in subjects from different ethnicities.},

While androgen deprivation has remained as the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment, resistance ensues leading to lethal disease. Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) encodes a pioneer factor that induces open chromatin conformation to allow the binding of other transcription factors. Through direct interactions with the Androgen Receptor (AR), FOXA1 helps to shape AR signaling that drives the growth and survival of normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. FOXA1 also possesses an AR-independent role of regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In prostate cancer, mutations converge onto the coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of FOXA1, leading to functional alterations. In addition, FOXA1 activity in prostate cancer can be modulated post-translationally through various mechanisms such as LSD1-mediated protein demethylation. In this review, we describe the latest discoveries related to the function and regulation of FOXA1 in prostate cancer, pointing to their relevance to guide future clinical interventions.},

However, how the correlative patterns in genome-wide DNA methylation change during the carcinogenic progress has not yet been explored.

We demonstrate how the study of changes in DNA methylation covariation patterns across normal, intra-epithelial neoplasia and invasive cancer allows the identification of CpG sites that indicate the risk of neoplastic transformation in stages prior to neoplasia. Importantly, we show that the covariation in DNA methylation at these risk CpG loci is maximal immediately prior to the onset of cancer, supporting the view that high epigenetic diversity in normal cells increases the risk of cancer. Consistent with this, we observe that invasive cancers exhibit increased covariation in DNA methylation at the risk CpG sites relative to normal tissue, but lower levels relative to pre-cancerous lesions. We further show that the identified risk CpG sites undergo preferential DNA methylation changes in relation to human papilloma virus infection and age. Results are validated in independent data including prospectively collected samples prior to neoplastic transformation. Our data are consistent with a phase transition model of carcinogenesis, in which epigenetic diversity is maximal prior to the onset of cancer. The model and algorithm proposed here may allow, in future, network biomarkers predicting the risk of neoplastic transformation to be identified.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been proposed that epigenetic variation may contribute to the risk of complex genetic diseases like cancer. We aimed to demonstrate that epigenetic changes in normal cells, collected years in advance of the first signs of morphological transformation, can predict the risk of such transformation. METHODS: We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of over 27,000 CpGs in cytologically normal cells of the uterine cervix from 152 women in a prospective nested case-control study. We used statistics based on differential variability to identify CpGs associated with the risk of transformation and a novel statistical algorithm called EVORA (Epigenetic Variable Outliers for Risk prediction Analysis) to make predictions. RESULTS: We observed many CpGs that were differentially variable between women who developed a non-invasive cervical neoplasia within 3 years of sample collection and those that remained disease-free. These CpGs exhibited heterogeneous outlier methylation profiles and overlapped strongly with CpGs undergoing age-associated DNA methylation changes in normal tissue. Using EVORA, we demonstrate that the risk of cervical neoplasia can be predicted in blind test sets (AUC = 0.66 (0.58 to 0.75)), and that assessment of DNAm variability allows more reliable identification of risk-associated CpGs than statistics based on differences in mean methylation levels. In independent data, EVORA showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect pre-invasive neoplasia and cervical cancer (AUC = 0.93 (0.86 to 1) and AUC = 1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the risk of neoplastic transformation can be predicted from DNA methylation profiles in the morphologically normal cell of origin of an epithelial cancer. Having profiled only 0.1\% of CpGs in the human genome, studies of wider coverage are likely to yield improved predictive and diagnostic models with the accuracy needed for clinical application.

  abstract = {Hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes represses transcription of these genes, conferring growth advantages to cancer cells. How these changes arise is poorly understood. Here we show that the activity of oxygen-dependent ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes is reduced by tumour hypoxia in human and mouse cells. TET enzymes catalyse DNA demethylation through 5-methylcytosine oxidation. This reduction in activity occurs independently of hypoxia-associated alterations in TET expression, proliferation, metabolism, hypoxia-inducible factor activity or reactive oxygen species, and depends directly on oxygen shortage. Hypoxia-induced loss of TET activity increases hypermethylation at gene promoters in vitro. In patients, tumour suppressor gene promoters are markedly more methylated in hypoxic tumour tissue, independent of proliferation, stromal cell infiltration and tumour characteristics. Our data suggest that up to half of hypermethylation events are due to hypoxia, with these events conferring a selective advantage. Accordingly, increased hypoxia in mouse breast tumours increases hypermethylation, while restoration of tumour oxygenation abrogates this effect. Tumour hypoxia therefore acts as a novel regulator of DNA methylation.},

Risk factors for PSCC include the absence of childhood circumcision, phimosis, chronic inflammation, poor penile hygiene, smoking, immunosuppression and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Several different subtypes of HPV-related and non-HPV-related penile cancers have been described, which also have different prognostic profiles. Localized disease can be effectively managed by topical therapy, surgery or radiotherapy. As PSCC is characterized by early lymphatic spread and imaging is inadequate for the detection of micrometastatic disease, correct and upfront surgical staging of the inguinal lymph nodes is crucial in disease management. Advanced stages of disease require multimodal management. Optimal sequencing of treatments and patient selection are still being investigated. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are the mainstay of systemic therapy for advanced PSCC, but they have poor and non-durable responses and high rates of toxic effects, indicating a need for the development of more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. Localized and advanced penile cancers and their treatment have profound physical and psychosexual effects on the quality of life of patients and survivors by altering sexual and urinary function and causing lymphoedema.},

Science, this issue p. 999 Intelligent machines using machine learning algorithms are ubiquitous, ranging from simple data analysis and pattern recognition tools to complex systems that achieve superhuman performance on various tasks. Ensuring that they do not exhibit undesirable behavior\textemdash that they do not, for example, cause harm to humans\textemdash is therefore a pressing problem. We propose a general and flexible framework for designing machine learning algorithms. This framework simplifies the problem of specifying and regulating undesirable behavior. To show the viability of this framework, we used it to create machine learning algorithms that precluded the dangerous behavior caused by standard machine learning algorithms in our experiments. Our framework for designing machine learning algorithms simplifies the safe and responsible application of machine learning. A machine learning algorithm design framework shifts the burden of avoiding undesirable behavior from user to designer.

  abstract = {Acute leukemias are systemic malignancies associated with a dire outcome. Because of low immunogenicity, leukemias display a remarkable ability to evade immune control and are often resistant to checkpoint blockade. Here, we discover that leukemia cells actively establish a suppressive environment to prevent immune attacks by co-opting a signaling axis that skews macrophages toward a tumor-promoting tissue repair phenotype, namely the GAS6/AXL axis. Using aggressive leukemia models, we demonstrate that ablation of the AXL receptor specifically in macrophages, or its ligand GAS6 in the environment, stimulates antileukemic immunity and elicits effective and lasting natural killer cell\textendash{} and T cell\textendash dependent immune response against na\"ive and treatment-resistant leukemia. Remarkably, AXL deficiency in macrophages also enables PD-1 checkpoint blockade in PD-1\textendash refractory leukemias. Finally, we provide proof-of-concept that a clinical-grade AXL inhibitor can be used in combination with standard-of-care therapy to cure established leukemia, regardless of AXL expression in malignant cells. Significance: Alternatively primed myeloid cells predict negative outcome in leukemia. By demonstrating that leukemia cells actively evade immune control by engaging AXL receptor tyrosine kinase in macrophages and promoting their alternative priming, we identified a target which blockade, using a clinical-grade inhibitor, is vital to unleashing the therapeutic potential of myeloid-centered immunotherapy.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659},

  abstract = {Summary An adverse intrauterine environment is associated with long-term physiological changes in offspring. These are believed to be mediated by epigenomic marks, including DNA methylation (DNAm). Changes in DNAm are often interpreted as damage or plastic responses of the embryo. Here, we propose that stochastic DNAm variation, generated during remodeling of the epigenome after fertilization, contributes to DNAm signatures of prenatal adversity through differential survival of embryos. Using a mathematical model of re-methylation in the early embryo, we demonstrate that selection, but not plasticity, will generate a characteristic reduction in DNAm variance at loci that contribute to survival. Such a reduction in DNAm variance was apparent in a human cohort prenatally exposed to the Dutch famine, illustrating that it is possible to detect a signature of selection on epigenomic variation. Selection should be considered as a possible mechanism linking prenatal adversity to subsequent health and may have implications when evaluating interventions.},

We used a bioinformatics approach to discover candidate oncogenic chromosomal aberrations on the basis of outlier gene expression. Two ETS transcription factors, ERG and ETV1, were identified as outliers in prostate cancer. We identified recurrent gene fusions of the 5{${'}$} untranslated region of TMPRSS2 to ERG or ETV1 in prostate cancer tissues with outlier expression. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that 23 of 29 prostate cancer samples harbor rearrangements in ERG or ETV1. Cell line experiments suggest that the androgen-responsive promoter elements of TMPRSS2 mediate the overexpression of ETS family members in prostate cancer. These results have implications in the development of carcinomas and the molecular diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Most human prostate cancers show a previously unknown gene rearrangement that makes them grow in response to male hormones, a mechanism that may also apply to other cancers.

  abstract = {Cellular identity relies on cell-type\textendash specific gene expression controlled at the transcriptional level by cis-regulatory elements (CREs). CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome, giving rise to individual CREs and clusters of CREs (COREs). Technical and biological features hinder CORE identification. We addressed these issues by developing an unsupervised machine learning approach termed clustering of genomic regions analysis method (CREAM). CREAM automates CORE detection from chromatin accessibility profiles that are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription regulators, proximal to highly expressed and essential genes, and discriminating cell identity. Although COREs share similarities with super-enhancers, we highlight differences in terms of the genomic distribution and structure of these cis-regulatory units. We further show the enhanced value of COREs over super-enhancers to identify master transcription regulators, highly expressed and essential genes defining cell identity. COREs enrich at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries. They are also preferentially bound by the chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesin, in contrast to super-enhancers, forming clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions and defining homotypic clusters of transcription regulator binding regions (HCTs). Finally, we show the clinical utility of CREAM to identify COREs across chromatin accessibility profiles to stratify more than 400 tumor samples according to their cancer type and to delineate cancer type\textendash specific active biological pathways. Collectively, our results support the utility of CREAM to delineate COREs underlying, with greater accuracy than individual CREs or super-enhancers, the cell-type\textendash specific biological underpinning across a wide range of normal and cancer cell types.},

However, formal, probability-based statistical inference should play no role in most scientific research, which is inherently exploratory, requiring flexible methods of analysis that inherently risk overfitting. The nature of exploratory work is that data are used to help guide model choice, and under these circumstances, uncertainty cannot be precisely quantified, because of the inevitable model selection bias that results. To be valid, statistical inference should be restricted to situations where the study design and analysis plan are specified prior to data collection. Exploratory data analysis provides the flexibility needed for most other situations, including statistical methods that are regularized, robust, or nonparametric. Of course, no individual statistical analysis should be considered sufficient to establish scientific validity: research requires many sets of data along many lines of evidence, with a watchfulness for systematic error. Replicating and predicting findings in new data and new settings is a stronger way of validating claims than blessing results from an isolated study with statistical inferences.},

We calculate the fixation probability of newly introduced mutants under constant selection. We show that the described population structure acts as a suppressor of selection compared to an unstructured population of the same size. The maximum suppression of selection is obtained, when the number of groups equals the number of individuals per group.

  abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for development and in diverse biological processes. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 maintains parental cell methylation patterns on daughter DNA strands in mitotic cells, however, the precise role of Dnmt1 in regulation of quiescent adult stem cells is not known. To examine the role of Dnmt1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we conditionally disrupted Dnmt1 in the hematopoietic system. Defects were observed in Dnmt1 deficient HSC self- renewal, niche retention, and in the ability of Dnmt1 deficient HSCs to give rise to multilineage hematopoiesis. Loss of Dnmt1 also had specific impact on myeloid progenitor cells, causing enhanced cell cycling and inappropriate expression of mature lineage genes. Dnmt1 regulates distinct patterns of methylation and expression of discrete gene families in long-term HSCs, multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitors, suggesting that Dnmt1 differentially controls these populations. These findings establish a unique and critical role for Dnmt1 in the primitive hematopoietic compartment.},

Although it is established that LMP1 represses E-cadherin expression and enhances the invasive ability of carcinoma cells, the mechanism underlying this repression remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that LMP1 induces the expression and activity of the DNA methyltransferases 1, 3a, and 3b, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme activity assay. This results in hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter and down-regulation of E-cadherin gene expression, as revealed by methylation-specific PCR, real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting data. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5'-Aza-2'dC, restores E-cadherin promoter activity and protein expression in LMP1-expressing cells, which in turn blocks cell migration ability, as demonstrated by the Transwell cell migration assay. Our findings suggest that LMP1 down-regulates E-cadherin gene expression and induces cell migration activity by using cellular DNA methylation machinery.},

We investigate power of EWAS to detect differential methylation using case-control and disease-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin designs with genome-wide DNA methylation arrays.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed simulations to estimate power under the case-control and discordant MZ twin EWAS study designs, under a range of epigenetic risk effect sizes and conditions. For example, to detect a 10\% mean methylation difference between affected and unaffected subjects at a genome-wide significance threshold of P\,=\,1\,\texttimes\,10(-6), 98\,MZ twin pairs were required to reach 80\% EWAS power, and 112 cases and 112 controls pairs were needed in the case-control design. We also estimated the minimum sample size required to reach 80\% EWAS power under both study designs. Our analyses highlighted several factors that significantly influenced EWAS power, including sample size, epigenetic risk effect size, the variance of DNA methylation at the locus of interest and the correlation in DNA methylation patterns within the twin sample.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: We provide power estimates for array-based DNA methylation EWAS under case-control and disease-discordant MZ twin designs, and explore multiple factors that impact on EWAS power.

To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55\%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82\% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such~predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.},

However, evolutionary events subsequent to chemotherapy could also explain changes in clonal dominance seen at relapse. We therefore investigated the mechanisms of selection in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) during induction chemotherapy where maximal cytoreduction occurs. To distinguish stochastic versus deterministic events, individual leukemias were transplanted into multiple xenografts and chemotherapy administered. Analyses of the immediate post-treatment leukemic residuum at single-cell resolution revealed that chemotherapy has little impact on genetic heterogeneity. Rather, it acts on extensive, previously unappreciated, transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity in BCP-ALL, dramatically reducing the spectrum of cell states represented, leaving a genetically polyclonal but phenotypically uniform population, with hallmark signatures relating to developmental stage, cell cycle and metabolism. Hence, canalization of the cell state accounts for a significant component of bottleneck selection during induction chemotherapy.},

Our previous study has shown that stem cell factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in B-ALL, but its functional roles and the mechanism that accounts for its upregulation in B-ALL remain unexplored. To address this question, we first surveyed the existing B-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples for SALL4 expression. We then selected the B-ALL cell lines with the highest SALL4 expression for functional studies. RNA interference was used to downregulate SALL4 expression in these cell lines. When compared with control cells, SALL4 knockdown cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis in~vitro, and decreased engraftment in a xenotransplant model in~vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that in SALL4 knockdown B-ALL cells, multiple caspase members involved in cell apoptosis pathway were upregulated. Next, we explored the mechanisms of aberrant SALL4 expression in B-ALL. We found that hypomethylation of the SALL4 CpG islands was correlated with its high expression. Furthermore, treatment of low SALL4-expressing B-ALL cell lines with DNA methylation inhibitor led to demethylation of the SALL4 CpG and increased SALL4 expression. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to show that the aberrant expression of SALL4 in B-ALL is associated with hypomethylation, and that SALL4 plays a key role in B-ALL cell survival and could be a potential novel target in B-ALL treatment.},

  abstract = {Genomic havoc from one fateful mistake Many human tumors display scrambled genomes that arise from two distinct mutational processes. The first, the chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle, produces gene amplification and genomic instability. The second, chromothripsis, generates massive, clustered genomic rearrangements in one or a few chromosomes. Umbreit et al. hypothesized that these two processes are mechanistically related and tested this idea by recreating essential steps of the BFB cycle in cultured cells (see the Perspective by Paiano and Nussenzweig). They found that chromothripsis arises from a cascade of events that begins with aberrant chromosome bridge formation during mitosis, followed by chromosome fragmentation, DNA damage, chromosome missegregation, and the formation of micronuclei. They propose a model that explains how a single cell division error (chromosome bridge formation) can generate many hallmark features of cancer genomes. Science, this issue p. 240; see also p. eaba0712 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle is a catastrophic mutational process, common during tumorigenesis, that results in gene amplification and drives rapid genome evolution. Major mechanisms underlying the BFB cycle are not understood, including its key feature of how chromosome bridges are broken. Furthermore, the simple pattern of DNA sequence rearrangement predicted by the canonical BFB model is not commonly observed in cancer genomes. Instead, the DNA sequence signature of BFB cycles is often accompanied by other genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis, another catastrophic mutational pattern. RATIONALEWe recreated essential steps of the BFB cycle in a defined system, enabling mechanistic studies and determination of the immediate and long-term genomic consequences of bridge formation. To identify the immediate outcomes of bridge breakage, we used live-cell imaging coupled with single-cell whole-genome sequencing (Look-Seq). Complex mutational mechanisms, some of which occurred over two generations, could be deconvolved by the comparison of haplotype copy number and structural variants in daughter or granddaughter cells. We then determined the long-term consequences of bridge breakage with genomic analysis of populations derived from single cells after breakage of a bridge formed from an experimentally induced dicentric fusion of chromosome 4. RESULTSWe showed that chromosome bridge breakage requires actomyosin-dependent mechanical force. Bridge formation and breakage is then coupled to a cascade of additional mutational events. For the initial step, we determined that direct mechanical bridge breakage can generate simple breaks and local DNA fragmentation, providing one explanation for a rearrangement pattern frequently observed in cancer genomes termed ``local jumps.'' Concomitantly, there is defective DNA replication of bridge DNA, which our data suggest can generate complex rearrangements. Some of these rearrangements exhibit a distinct sequence signature of tandem arrays of many short (\textasciitilde 200 base pairs) insertions that we term ``Tandem Short Template (TST) jumps.'' We validated the presence of TST jumps in a human cancer by use of single-molecule long-read DNA sequencing. Next, a second wave of DNA damage and increased chromothripsis occurs during the mitosis after bridge formation, when chromosomes from broken bridges undergo an unexpected burst of aberrant DNA replication. Last, these damaged bridge chromosomes missegregate with high frequency and form micronuclei in the following cell cycle, which can generate additional cycles of bridging, micronucleation, and chromothripsis. Genome sequence analysis of clonal populations established that the breakage of chromosome bridges initiates iterative cycles of complex karyotype evolution. We observed an analogous series of events after the formation of micronuclei, suggesting a unifying model for how cancer-associated defects in nuclear architecture (``nuclear atypia'') promote genome instability. CONCLUSIONWe identified a cascade of events that explains how a single cell division error\textemdash chromosome bridge formation\textemdash can rapidly generate many hallmark features of cancer genomes, including ongoing genome evolution with subclonal heterogeneity. These results motivate a substantial revision of the chromosome BFB model, establishing that episodes of chromothripsis will be inherently interwoven with BFB cycles. These mutational events are common in cancer but likely also occur during development and across organismal evolution. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/content/sci/368/6488/eaba0712/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A storm of mutagenesis generates cancer genome complexity from a single cell division error.The interphase actomyosin cytoskeleton (green fibers) stretches and breaks chromosome bridges, promoting local chromosome fragmentation (damaged DNA indicated in red). Defective DNA replication, first during interphase and later in the subsequent mitosis, generates additional DNA damage and chromothripsis, in some instances leaving behind a specific mutational signature (TST jumps). Bridge chromosomes frequently missegregate and form micronuclei, promoting additional chromothripsis. The chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle is a mutational process that produces gene amplification and genome instability. Signatures of BFB cycles can be observed in cancer genomes alongside chromothripsis, another catastrophic mutational phenomenon. We explain this association by elucidating a mutational cascade that is triggered by a single cell division error\textemdash chromosome bridge formation\textemdash that rapidly increases genomic complexity. We show that actomyosin forces are required for initial bridge breakage. Chromothripsis accumulates, beginning with aberrant interphase replication of bridge DNA. A subsequent burst of DNA replication in the next mitosis generates extensive DNA damage. During this second cell division, broken bridge chromosomes frequently missegregate and form micronuclei, promoting additional chromothripsis. We propose that iterations of this mutational cascade generate the continuing evolution and subclonal heterogeneity characteristic of many human cancers. The genomic complexity of a cancer cell is traced to aberrant formation of a chromosome bridge during one cell division.

Expression of Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) is controlled by genomic imprinting, mediated by silencing of the maternal allele. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 (LOI) is linked to intestinal and colorectal cancers, causally in murine models and epidemiologically in humans. However, the molecular underpinnings of the LOI phenotype are not clear. Surprisingly, in LOI cells, we find a reversal of the relative activities of two canonical signaling pathways triggered by IGF2, causing further rebalancing between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. A predictive mathematical model shows that this network rebalancing quantitatively accounts for the effect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in both WT and LOI cells. This mechanism also quantitatively explains both the stable LOI phenotype and the therapeutic window for selective killing of LOI cells, and thus prevention of epigenetically controlled cancers. These findings suggest a framework for understanding epigenetically modified cell signaling.},

Here, we present GENOVA: a user-friendly software package to analyse and visualise chromosome conformation capture (3C) data. GENOVA is an R-package that includes the most common Hi-C analyses, such as compartment and insulation score analysis. It can create annotated heatmaps to visualise the contact frequency at a specific locus and aggregate Hi-C signal over user-specified genomic regions such as ChIP-seq data. Finally, our package supports output from the major mapping-pipelines. We demonstrate the capabilities of GENOVA by analysing Hi-C data from HAP1 cell lines in which the cohesin-subunits SA1 and SA2 were knocked out. We find that {$\Delta$}SA1 cells gain intra-TAD interactions and increase compartmentalisation. {$\Delta$}SA2 cells have longer loops and a less compartmentalised genome. These results suggest that cohesinSA1 forms longer loops, while cohesinSA2 plays a role in forming and maintaining intra-TAD interactions. Our data supports the model that the genome is provided structure in 3D by the counter-balancing of loop formation on one hand, and compartmentalization on the other hand. By differentially controlling loops, cohesinSA1 and cohesinSA2 therefore also affect nuclear compartmentalization. We show that GENOVA is an easy to use R-package, that allows researchers to explore Hi-C data in great detail.},

We asked if replication or cell-cycle arrest affects the global levels of methylation or leads to hypomethylated blocks as observed in other settings. We used fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate primary dermal fibroblasts in G0, G1 and G2 based on DNA content and Ki67 staining. We additionally examined G0 cells arrested by contact inhibition for one week to determine the effects of extended arrest. We analyzed genome wide DNA methylation from sorted cells using whole genome bisulfite sequencing. This analysis demonstrated no global changes or large-scale hypomethylated blocks in any of the examined cell cycle phases, indicating that global levels of methylation are stable with replication and arrest.},

However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a~technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of~p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments.},

While naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be maintained in a hypomethylated state with open chromatin when grown using two small-molecule inhibitors (2i)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in contrast to serum/LIF-grown ESCs that resemble early post-implantation embryos, broader features of the ground-state pluripotent epigenome are not well understood. We identified epigenetic features of mouse ESCs cultured using 2i/LIF or serum/LIF by proteomic profiling of chromatin-associated complexes and histone modifications. Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and its product H3K27me3 are~highly abundant in 2i/LIF ESCs, and H3K27me3 is~distributed genome-wide in a CpG-dependent fashion. Consistently, PRC2-deficient ESCs showed increased DNA methylation at sites normally occupied by H3K27me3 and increased H4 acetylation. Inhibiting DNA methylation in PRC2-deficient ESCs did not affect their viability or~transcriptome. Our findings suggest a unique H3K27me3 configuration protects naive ESCs from lineage priming, and they reveal widespread epigenetic crosstalk in ground-state pluripotency.},

Although effective surgical and radiation treatments exist for clinically localized prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer remains essentially incurable. Here we show, through gene expression profiling1, that the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)2,3 is overexpressed in hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes4 targeted against EZH2 reduce the amounts of EZH2 protein present in prostate cells and also inhibit cell proliferation in vitro. Ectopic expression of EZH2 in prostate cells induces transcriptional repression of a specific cohort of genes. Gene silencing mediated by EZH2 requires the SET domain and is attenuated by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent technological advances allow the measurement, in a single Hi-C experiment, of the frequencies of physical contacts among pairs of genomic loci at a genome-wide scale. The next challenge is to infer, from the resulting DNA-DNA contact maps, accurate 3D models of how chromosomes fold and fit into the nucleus. Many existing inference methods rely on multidimensional scaling (MDS), in which the pairwise distances of the inferred model are optimized to resemble pairwise distances derived directly from the contact counts. These approaches, however, often optimize a heuristic objective function and require strong assumptions about the biophysics of DNA to transform interaction frequencies to spatial distance, and thereby may lead to incorrect structure reconstruction. METHODS: We propose a novel approach to infer a consensus 3D structure of a genome from Hi-C data. The method incorporates a statistical model of the contact counts, assuming that the counts between two loci follow a Poisson distribution whose intensity decreases with the physical distances between the loci. The method can automatically adjust the transfer function relating the spatial distance to the Poisson intensity and infer a genome structure that best explains the observed data. RESULTS: We compare two variants of our Poisson method, with or without optimization of the transfer function, to four different MDS-based algorithms-two metric MDS methods using different stress functions, a non-metric version of MDS and ChromSDE, a recently described, advanced MDS method-on a wide range of simulated datasets. We demonstrate that the Poisson models reconstruct better structures than all MDS-based methods, particularly at low coverage and high resolution, and we highlight the importance of optimizing the transfer function. On publicly available Hi-C data from mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that the Poisson methods lead to more reproducible structures than MDS-based methods when we use data generated using different restriction enzymes, and when we reconstruct structures at different resolutions. Availability and implementation: A Python implementation of the proposed method is available at http://cbio.ensmp.fr/pastis. CONTACT: william-noble@uw.edu or jean-philippe.vert@mines.org.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{} DNA methylation can cause heritable phenotypic modifications in the absence of changes in DNA sequence. Environmental stresses can trigger methylation changes and this may have evolutionary consequences, even in the absence of sequence variation. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent environmentally induced methylation changes are transmitted to offspring, and whether observed methylation variation is truly independent or a downstream consequence of genetic variation between individuals. \textbullet{} Genetically identical apomictic dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) plants were exposed to different ecological stresses, and apomictic offspring were raised in a common unstressed environment. We used methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to screen genome-wide methylation alterations triggered by stress treatments and to assess the heritability of induced changes. \textbullet{} Various stresses, most notably chemical induction of herbivore and pathogen defenses, triggered considerable methylation variation throughout the genome. Many modifications were faithfully transmitted to offspring. Stresses caused some epigenetic divergence between treatment and controls, but also increased epigenetic variation among plants within treatments. \textbullet{} These results show the following. First, stress-induced methylation changes are common and are mostly heritable. Second, sequence-independent, autonomous methylation variation is readily generated. This highlights the potential of epigenetic inheritance to play an independent role in evolutionary processes, which is superimposed on the system of genetic inheritance.},

  abstract = {Recent studies showing a correlation between the levels of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase (DNA MTase) enzyme activity and tumorigenicity have implicated this enzyme in the carcinogenic process. Moreover, hypermethylation of CpG island-containing promoters is associated with the inactivation of genes important to tumor initiation and progression. One proposed role for DNA MTase in tumorigenesis is therefore a direct role in the de novo methylation of these otherwise unmethylated CpG islands. In this study, we sought to determine whether increased levels of DNA MTase could directly affect CpG island methylation. A full-length cDNA for human DNA MTase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was constitutively expressed in human fibroblasts. Individual clones derived from cells transfected with DNA MTase (HMT) expressed 1- to 50-fold the level of DNA MTase protein and enzyme activity of the parental cell line or clones transfected with the control vector alone (Neo). To determine the effects of DNA MTase overexpression on CpG island methylation, we examined 12 endogenous CpG island loci in the HMT clones. HMT clones expressing {$>$} or = 9-fold the parental levels of DNA MTase activity were significantly hypermethylated relative to at least 11 Neo clones at five CpG island loci. In the HMT clones, methylation reached nearly 100\% at susceptible CpG island loci with time in culture. In contrast, there was little change in the methylation status in the Neo clones over the same time frame. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of DNA MTase can drive the de novo methylation of susceptible CpG island loci, thus providing support for the idea that DNA MTase can contribute to tumor progression through CpG island methylation-mediated gene inactivation.},

  abstract = {Summary Cohesin extrusion is thought to play a central role in establishing the architecture of mammalian genomes. However, extrusion has not been visualized in~vivo, and thus, its functional impact and energetics are unknown. Using ultra-deep Hi-C, we show that loop domains form by a process that requires cohesin ATPases. Once formed, however, loops and compartments are maintained for hours without energy input. Strikingly, without ATP, we observe the emergence of hundreds of CTCF-independent loops that link regulatory DNA.~We also identify architectural ``stripes,'' where a loop anchor interacts with entire domains at high~frequency. Stripes often tether super-enhancers to cognate promoters, and in B cells, they facilitate Igh transcription and recombination. Stripe anchors represent major hotspots for topoisomerase-mediated lesions, which promote chromosomal translocations and cancer. In plasmacytomas, stripes can deregulate Igh-translocated oncogenes. We propose that higher organisms have coopted cohesin extrusion to enhance transcription and recombination, with implications for tumor development.},

Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3\textendash 6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor\textendash DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.},

We performed comparative high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) in four mammals and characterized the conservation and divergence of chromosomal contact insulation and the resulting domain architectures within distantly related genomes. We show that the modular organization of chromosomes is robustly conserved in syntenic regions and that this is compatible with conservation of the binding landscape of the insulator protein CTCF. Specifically, conserved CTCF sites are co-localized with cohesin, are enriched at strong topological domain borders, and bind to DNA motifs with orientations that define the directionality of CTCF's long-range interactions. Conversely, divergent CTCF binding between species is correlated with divergence of internal domain structure, likely driven by local CTCF binding sequence changes, demonstrating how genome evolution can be linked to a continuous flux of local conformation changes. We also show that large-scale domains are reorganized during genome evolution as intact modules.},

While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data using embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.},

A four-letter DNA alphabet only partially describes the possible diversity of nucleobases a transcription factor might encounter. For instance, cytosine is often present in a covalently modified form: 5-methylcytosine (5mC). 5mC can be successively oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Just as transcription factors distinguish one unmodified nucleobase from another, some have been shown to distinguish unmodified bases from these covalently modified bases. Modification-sensitive transcription factors provide a mechanism by which widespread changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation can dramatically shift active gene expression programs.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}To understand the effect of modified nucleobases on gene regulation, we developed methods to discover motifs and identify transcription factor binding sites in DNA with covalent modifications. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T alphabet, adding m (5mC) h (5hmC), f (5fC), and c (5caC). We additionally add symbols to encode guanine complementary to these modified cytosine nucleobases, as well as symbols to represent states of ambiguous modification. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix model of transcription factor binding affinity to an expanded alphabet. We developed a program, Cytomod, to create a modified sequence. We also enhanced the MEME Suite to be able to handle custom alphabets. These versions permit users to specify new alphabets, anticipating future alphabet expansions.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We created an expanded-alphabet sequence using whole-genome maps of 5mC and 5hmC in naive \emph{ex vivo} mouse T cells. Using this sequence and ChIP-seq data from Mouse ENCODE and others, we identified modification-sensitive \emph{cis}-regulatory modules. We elucidated various known methylation binding preferences, including the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP\emph{{$\beta$}} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. We demonstrated that our method is robust to parameter perturbations, with transcription factors' sensitivities for methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA broadly conserved across a range of modified base calling thresholds. Hypothesis testing across different threshold values was used to determine cutoffs most suitable for further analyses. Using these known binding preferences to tune model parameters enables discovery of novel modified motifs.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Discussion{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Hypothesis testing of motif central enrichment provides a natural means of differentially assessing modified versus unmodified binding affinity, without most of the limitations of a \emph{de novo} analysis.

  abstract = {High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-read sequencing is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. However, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here we introduce and validate a new long-read ONT based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single cell samples.},

We developed a framework for harmonizing variant interpretations to produce a meta-knowledgebase of 12,856 aggregate interpretations. We demonstrated large gains in overlap between resources across variants, diseases and drugs as a result of this harmonization. We subsequently demonstrated improved matching between a patient cohort and harmonized interpretations of potential clinical significance, observing an increase from an average of 33\% per individual knowledgebase to 57\% in aggregate. Our analyses illuminate the need for open, interoperable sharing of variant interpretation data.

For scientific and clinical interests, it is of fundamental importance to understand their properties and the dynamic variations among different phenotypes, specifically under radio- and/or chemo-therapy. Currently there are two controversial models describing tumor heterogeneity, the cancer stem cell (CSC) model and the stochastic model. To clarify the controversy, we measured probabilities of different division types and transitions of cells via in situ immunofluorescence. Based on the experiment data, we constructed a model that combines the CSC with the stochastic concepts, showing the existence of both distinctive CSC subpopulations and the stochastic transitions from NSCCs to CSCs. The results showed that the dynamic variations between CSCs and non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs) can be simulated with the model. Further studies also showed that the model can be used to describe the dynamics of the two subpopulations after radiation treatment. More importantly, analysis demonstrated that the experimental detectable equilibrium CSC proportion can be achieved only when the stochastic transitions from NSCCs to CSCs occur, indicating that tumor heterogeneity may exist in a model coordinating with both the CSC and the stochastic concepts. The mathematic model based on experimental parameters may contribute to a better understanding of the tumor heterogeneity, and provide references on the dynamics of CSC subpopulation during radiotherapy.},

Our framework can automatically resolve complex SVs, reconstruct local Hi-C maps surrounding the breakpoints, normalize copy number variation and allele effects and predict chromatin loops induced by SVs. We applied NeoLoopFinder in Hi-C data from 50 cancer cell lines and primary tumors and identified tens of recurrent genes associated with enhancer hijacking. To experimentally validate NeoLoopFinder, we deleted the hijacked enhancers in prostate adenocarcinoma cells using CRISPR\textendash Cas9, which significantly reduced expression of the target oncogene. In summary, NeoLoopFinder enables identification of critical oncogenic regulatory elements that can potentially reveal therapeutic targets.},

Interplay between FOXA1 and breast cancer specific signaling pathways has been reported previously, indicating a regulation network on FOXA1 in breast cancer cells. Here in this study, we aimed to identify which are the proteins that could potentially control FOXA1 function in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers. We first established a luciferase reporter system reflecting FOXA1 binding to DNA. Then, we applied high throughput chemical screening of multiple protein targets and mass spectrometry in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers: ER positive/HER2 negative (MCF-7), ER positive/HER2 positive (BT474), and ER negative/HER2 positive (MDA-MB-453). Regardless of estrogen receptor status, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) enriched cell lines showed similar response to kinase inhibitors, indicating the control of FOXA1 by cell signaling kinases. Among these kinases, we identified additional receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases as regulators of FOXA1. Furthermore, we performed proteomics experiments from FOXA1 inmunoprecipitated protein complex to identify that FOXA1 interacts with several proteins. Among all the targets, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a positive factor to interact with FOXA1 in BT474 cell line. In silico analyses confirmed that cyclin-dependent kinases might be the kinases responsible for FOXA1 phosphorylation at the Forkhead domain and the transactivation domain. These results reveal that FOXA1 is potentially regulated by multiple kinases. The cell cycle control kinase CDK1 might control directly FOXA1 by phosphorylation and other kinases indirectly by means of regulating other proteins.},

Thus, epimutations can be subject to natural selection and impact the fitness and evolution of organisms. Based on the framework of the modified Tajima's D test for DNA mutations, we developed a neutrality test with the statistic "D(m)" to detect selection forces on DNA methylation mutations using single methylation polymorphisms. With computer simulation and empirical data analysis, we compared the D(m) test with the original and modified Tajima's D tests and demonstrated that the D(m) test is suitable for detecting selection on epimutations and outperforms original/modified Tajima's D tests. Due to the higher resetting rate of epimutations, the interpretation of D(m) on epimutations and Tajima's D test on DNA mutations could be different in inferring natural selection. Analyses using simulated and empirical genome-wide polymorphism data suggested that genes under genetic and epigenetic selections behaved differently. We applied the D(m) test to recently originated Arabidopsis and human genes, and showed that newly evolved genes contain higher level of rare epialleles, suggesting that epimutation may play a role in origination and evolution of genes and genomes. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of the D(m) test to detect whether the loci are under selection regarding DNA methylation. Our analytical metrics and methodology could contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes of genes and genomes in the field of epigenetics.

  abstract = {Summary Chemotherapy of a combination of DNA alkylating agents, procarbazine and lomustine (CCNU), and a microtubule poison, vincristine, offers a significant benefit to a subset of glioma patients. The benefit of this regimen, known as PCV, was recently linked to IDH mutation that occurs frequently in glioma and produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG), a competitive inhibitor of {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate ({$\alpha$}-KG). We report here that D-2-HG inhibits the {$\alpha$}-KG-dependent alkB homolog (ALKBH) DNA repair enzymes. Cells expressing mutant IDH display reduced repair kinetics, accumulate more DNA damages, and are sensitized to alkylating agents. The observed sensitization to alkylating agents requires the catalytic activity of mutant IDH to produce D-2-HG and can be reversed by the deletion of mutant IDH allele or overexpression of ALKBH2 or AKLBH3. Our results suggest that impairment of DNA repair may contribute to tumorigenesis driven by IDH mutations and that alkylating agents may merit exploration for treating IDH-mutated cancer patients.},

However, little is known about the mechanisms through which TAD reorganization affects cell fate or how master transcription factors affect TAD structures during cell fate transitions. Here, we show extensive TAD reorganization during somatic cell reprogramming, which is correlated with gene transcription and changes in cellular identity. Manipulating TAD reorganization promotes reprogramming, and the dynamics of concentrated chromatin loops in OCT4 phase separated condensates contribute to TAD reorganization. Disrupting OCT4 phase separation attenuates TAD reorganization and reprogramming, which can be rescued by fusing an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to OCT4. We developed an approach termed TAD reorganization-based multiomics analysis (TADMAN), which identified reprogramming regulators. Together, these findings elucidate a role and mechanism of TAD reorganization, regulated by OCT4 phase separation, in cellular reprogramming.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Wang et al. created a method to fragment the E. coli genome into independent chromosomes that can be modified, rearranged, and recombined. The efficient fission of the unmodified E. coli genome into two defined, stable pairs of synthetic chromosomes provides common intermediates for large-scale genome manipulations such as inversion and translocation. Fusion of synthetic chromosomes from distinct cells generated a single genome in a target cell. Precise, rapid, large-scale genome engineering operations are useful tools for creating diverse synthetic genomes. Science, this issue p. 922 The design and creation of synthetic genomes provide a powerful approach to understanding and engineering biology. However, it is often limited by the paucity of methods for precise genome manipulation. Here, we demonstrate the programmed fission of the Escherichia coli genome into diverse pairs of synthetic chromosomes and the programmed fusion of synthetic chromosomes to generate genomes with user-defined inversions and translocations. We further combine genome fission, chromosome transplant, and chromosome fusion to assemble genomic regions from different strains into a single genome. Thus, we program the scarless assembly of new genomes with nucleotide precision, a key step in the convergent synthesis of genomes from diverse progenitors. This work provides a set of precise, rapid, large-scale (megabase) genome-engineering operations for creating diverse synthetic genomes.

Here, we present a new experimental approach, methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing (MeSMLR-seq), for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single DNA molecules and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. MeSMLR-seq offers direct measurements of both nucleosome-occupied and nucleosome-evicted regions on a single DNA molecule, which is challenging for many existing methods. We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding the transcription start site for silent and actively transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin status spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single DNA molecules during transcription reprogramming. In addition, we revealed the coupled changes of chromatin accessibility for two neighboring glucose transporter genes in response to changes in glucose concentration.},

Because of its critical role in genome function, CTCF binding patterns have long been assumed to be largely invariant across different cellular environments. Here we analyze genome-wide occupancy patterns of CTCF by ChIP-seq in 19 diverse human cell types, including normal primary cells and immortal lines. We observed highly reproducible yet surprisingly plastic genomic binding landscapes, indicative of strong cell-selective regulation of CTCF occupancy. Comparison with massively parallel bisulfite sequencing data indicates that 41\% of variable CTCF binding is linked to differential DNA methylation, concentrated at two critical positions within the CTCF recognition sequence. Unexpectedly, CTCF binding patterns were markedly different in normal versus immortal cells, with the latter showing widespread disruption of CTCF binding associated with increased methylation. Strikingly, this disruption is accompanied by up-regulation of CTCF expression, with the result that both normal and immortal cells maintain the same average number of CTCF occupancy sites genome-wide. These results reveal a tight linkage between DNA methylation and the global occupancy patterns of a major sequence-specific regulatory factor.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics in hematopoiesis Cells accumulate mutations as we age, and these mutations can be a source of diseases such as cancer. How cells containing mutations evolve, are maintained, and proliferate within the body has not been well characterized. Using a quantitative framework, Watson et al. applied population genetic theory to estimate mutation accumulation in cells in blood from sequencing data derived from nearly 50,000 healthy individuals (see the Perspective by Curtis). By evaluating how mutations differ between blood cell populations, a phenomenon known as clonal hematopoiesis, the researchers could observe how recurrent mutations can drive certain clonal lineages to high frequencies within an individual. The risk of specific mutations, some of which are associated with leukemias, rising to high frequencies may therefore be a function of cellular selection and the age at which the mutation originated. Science, this issue p. 1449; see also p. 1426 Somatic mutations acquired in healthy tissues as we age are major determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance remains largely unknown. Blood sequencing data from \textasciitilde 50,000 individuals reveal how mutation, genetic drift, and fitness shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood (clonal hematopoiesis). We show that positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal hematopoiesis, provide bounds on the number of hematopoietic stem cells, and quantify the fitness advantages of key pathogenic variants, at single-nucleotide resolution, as well as the distribution of fitness effects (fitness landscape) within commonly mutated driver genes. These data are consistent with clonal hematopoiesis being driven by a continuing risk of mutations and clonal expansions that become increasingly detectable with age. Blood sequencing data from \textasciitilde 50,000 individuals reveals how mutation, genetic drift, and fitness differences shape the diversity of healthy blood.

Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

  abstract = {Most mutations in cancer genomes are thought to be acquired after the initiating event, which may cause genomic instability and drive clonal evolution. However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is ``captured'' as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.},

On the basis of their histological appearance, they have been traditionally classified as astrocytic, oligodendroglial or ependymal tumours and assigned WHO grades I\textendash IV, which indicate different degrees of malignancy. Tremendous progress in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling has resulted in new concepts of classifying and treating gliomas. Diffusely infiltrating gliomas in adults are now separated into three overarching tumour groups with distinct natural histories, responses to treatment and outcomes: isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, 1p/19q co-deleted tumours with mostly oligodendroglial morphology that are associated with the best prognosis; IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-co-deleted tumours with mostly astrocytic histology that are associated with intermediate outcome; and IDH wild-type, mostly higher WHO grade (III or IV) tumours that are associated with poor prognosis. Gliomas in children are molecularly distinct from those in adults, the majority being WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytomas characterized by circumscribed growth, favourable prognosis and frequent BRAF gene fusions or mutations. Ependymal tumours can be molecularly subdivided into distinct epigenetic subgroups according to location and prognosis. Although surgery, radiotherapy and alkylating agent chemotherapy are still the mainstay of treatment, individually tailored strategies based on tumour-intrinsic dominant signalling pathways and antigenic tumour profiles may ultimately improve outcome.

Recent progresses of single cell multi-omics sequencing techniques are also reviewed. These techniques are emerging as powerful tools for unravelling the unique epigenomic features of rare cell types and epigenetic heterogeneity within a seemingly homogenous cell population.

We find that the neutral power law fits with high precision 323 of 904 cancers from 14 types and from different cohorts. In malignancies identified as evolving neutrally, all clonal selection seemingly occurred before the onset of cancer growth and not in later-arising subclones, resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible for intratumoral heterogeneity. Reanalyzing cancer sequencing data within the neutral framework allowed the measurement, in each patient, of both the in vivo mutation rate and the order and timing of mutations. This result provides a new way to interpret existing cancer genomic data and to discriminate between functional and non-functional intratumoral heterogeneity.},

Here we reconsider from first principles the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities. Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.},

Chromosome conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridisation assays were used to investigate the changes in chromatin conformation that result from these manipulations.

Here we measure clone dynamics in human cancers by using computational modeling of subclonal selection and theoretical population genetics applied to high-throughput sequencing data. Our method determined the detectable subclonal architecture of tumor samples and simultaneously measured the selective advantage and time of appearance of each subclone. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach and the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are recorded in the genome. Application of our method to high-depth sequencing data from breast, gastric, blood, colon and lung cancer samples, as well as metastatic deposits, showed that detectable subclones under selection, when present, consistently emerged early during tumor growth and had a large fitness advantage ({$>$}20\%). Our quantitative framework provides new insight into the evolutionary trajectories of human cancers and facilitates predictive measurements in individual tumors from widely available sequencing data.},

Recently, TET1 was found to hydroxylate the methyl group of mC, converting it to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC). Here we show that TET1 binds throughout the genome of embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at transcription start sites (TSSs) of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also enriched at CpG-rich TSSs. We provide evidence further that TET1 has a role in transcriptional repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A co-repressor complex. We propose that TET1 fine-tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequences and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation fidelity.},

These recommendations synthesize inspiration from our own work, from the experiences of the thousands of people who have taken part in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops over the past six years, and from a variety of other guides. Our recommendations are aimed specifically at people who are new to research computing. Author Summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, they take days or weeks to do things that could be done in minutes or hours, are often unable to reproduce their own work (much less the work of others), and have no idea how reliable their computational results are. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt regardless of their current level of technical skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources, from our daily lives, and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

This is often observed in animals where males produce many more sperm than females produce eggs, and is thought to result from differences in the number of replication-associated mutations accumulated in each sex. Thus, studies of male mutation bias have the capacity to reveal information about the replication-dependent or replication-independent nature of different mutations. The availability of whole genome sequences for many species, as well as for multiple individuals within a species, has opened the door to studying factors, both sequence-specific and those acting on the genome globally, that affect differences in mutation rates between males and females. Here, we assess the advantages that genomic sequences provide for studies of male mutation bias and general mutation mechanisms, discuss major challenges left unresolved, and speculate about the direction of future studies.},

Methods based on chromatin conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4\textendash 6. However, changes in chromatin organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220\,nm) nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000\,cells) within a complex tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene expression. We discover extensive `melting' of long genes when they are highly expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions.},

However, the 3D organization of chromosomes during human brain development and its role in regulating gene networks dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia4,5,6, are unknown. Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene. This work provides a framework for understanding the effect of non-coding regulatory elements on human brain development and the evolution of cognition, and highlights novel mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.},

In nearly all French-American-British leukemia subtypes, we found p15methylation in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 58\% (46/79) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL). An identical alteration was detected in blood plasma from 11 of 12 of these patients (92\%). We also demonstrated for the first time concomitant p16and p15 methylation in 22\% (8/37) of adults with AML or ALL, exclusively in those with M2, M4, or L2 subtypes. According to cytogenetic data from 35 patients with ALL, AML, or ABL, 82\% (14/17) of those with unmethylated p15 alleles had normal karyotypes or hyperdiploidies associated with a favorable prognosis. Conversely, 44\% (8/18) of patients with p15 methylation had chromosomal translocations, inversions, or deletions, suggesting an interplay of these abnormalities with p15 methylation. As a prognostic marker for disease monitoring, p15 methylation appears to be more widely applicable than BCR-ABL, AF4-MLL, andAML1-ETO transcripts, which were detectable in only 8\% (4/48) of patients by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Thirty-nine of 43 blood samples (91\%) sequentially collected from 12 patients with AML, ALL, or ABL showed p15 methylation status in excellent concordance with morphologic disease stage. Early detection of p15methylation at apparent remission or its acquisition during follow-up may prove valuable for predicting relapse. Overall survival of patients with p15 methylation was notably shortened among 38 adults with AML and 12 adults with ALL. Aberrant p15 methylation may have important prognostic implications for clinical monitoring and risk assessment.},

We asked if recurrent aberrant DNA methylation plays a role in childhood ALL and have defined a genome-scale DNA methylation profile associated with the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype of pediatric ALL. Archival bone marrow smears from 19 children collected at diagnosis and remission were used to derive a disease specific DNA methylation profile. The gene signature was confirmed in an independent cohort of 86 patients. A further 163 patients were analyzed for DNA methylation of a three gene signature. We found that the DNA methylation signature at diagnosis was unique from remission. Fifteen loci were sufficient to discriminate leukemia from disease-free samples and purified CD34+ cells. DNA methylation of these loci was recurrent irrespective of cytogenetic subtype of pre-B cell ALL. We show that recurrent aberrant genomic methylation is a common feature of pre-B ALL, suggesting a shared pathway for disease development. By revealing new DNA methylation markers associated with disease, this study has identified putative targets for development of novel epigenetic-based therapies.},

Recent developments in whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology have enabled genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation at single base pair resolution. Many experiments have been conducted to compare DNA methylation profiles under different biological contexts, with the goal of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Due to the high cost of WGBS experiments, many studies are still conducted without biological replicates. Methods and tools available for analyzing such data are very limited.We develop a statistical method, DSS-single, for detecting DMRs from WGBS data without replicates. We characterize the count data using a rigorous model that accounts for the spatial correlation of methylation levels, sequence depth and biological variation. We demonstrate that using information from neighboring CG sites, biological variation can be estimated accurately even without replicates. DMR detection is then carried out via a Wald test procedure. Simulations demonstrate that DSS-single has greater sensitivity and accuracy than existing methods, and an analysis of H1 versus IMR90 cell lines suggests that it also yields the most biologically meaningful results. DSS-single is implemented in the Bioconductor package DSS.},

  abstract = {ChIP seq is a widely used assay to measure genome-wide protein binding. The decrease in costs associated with sequencing has led to a rise in the number of studies that investigate protein binding across treatment conditions or cell lines. In addition to the identification of binding sites, new studies evaluate the variation in protein binding between conditions. A number of approaches to study differential transcription factor binding have recently been developed. Several of these methods build upon established methods from RNA-seq to quantify differences in read counts. We compare how these new approaches perform on different data sets from the ENCODE project to illustrate the impact of data processing pipelines under different study designs. The performance of normalization methods for differential ChIP-seq depends strongly on the variation in total amount of protein bound between conditions, with total read count outperforming effective library size, or variants thereof, when a large variation in binding was studied. Use of input subtraction to correct for non-specific binding showed a relatively modest impact on the number of differential peaks found and the fold change accuracy to biological validation, however a larger impact might be expected for samples with more extreme copy number variations between them. Still, it did identify a small subset of novel differential regions while excluding some differential peaks in regions with high background signal. These results highlight proper scaling for between-sample data normalization as critical for differential transcription factor binding analysis and suggest bioinformaticians need to know about the variation in level of total protein binding between conditions to select the best analysis method. At the same time, validation using fold-change estimates from qRT-PCR suggests there is still room for further method improvement.},

  abstract = {In the study of DNA methylation, genetic variation between species, strains, or individuals can result in CpG sites that are exclusive to a subset of samples, and insertions and deletions can rearrange the spatial distribution of CpGs. How to account for this variation in an analysis of the interplay between sequence variation and DNA methylation is not well understood, especially when the number of CpG differences between samples is large. Here we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencint data on two highly divergent inbred mouse strains to study this problem. We find that while the large number of strain-specific CpGs necessitates considerations regarding the reference genomes used during alignment, properties such as CpG density are surprisingly conserved across the genome. We introduce a method for including strain-specific CpGs in differential analysis, and show that accounting for strain-specific CpGs increases the power to find differentially methylated regions between the strains. Our method uses smoothing to impute methylation levels at strain-specific sites, thereby allowing strain-specific CpGs to contribute to the analysis, and also allowing us to account for differences in the spatial occurrences of CpGs. Our results have implications for analysis of genetic variation and DNA methylation using bisulfite-converted DNA.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The DNA of most vertebrates is depleted in CpG dinucleotide: a C followed by a G in the 5 to 3 direction. CpGs are the target for DNA methylation, a chemical modification of cytosine (C) heritable during cell division and the most well-characterized epigenetic mechanism. The remaining CpGs tend to cluster in regions referred to as CpG islands (CGI). Knowing CGI locations is important because they mark functionally relevant epigenetic loci in development and disease. For various mammals, including human, a readily available and widely used list of CGI is available from the UCSC Genome Browser. This list was derived using algorithms that search for regions satisfying a definition of CGI proposed by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer more than 20 years ago. Recent findings, enabled by advances in tech-nology that permit direct measurement of epigenetic endpoints at a whole-genome scale, motivate the need to adapt the current CGI definition. In this paper, we propose a procedure, guided by hidden Markov models, that permits an extensible approach to detecting CGI. The main advantage of our approach over others is that it summarizes the evidence for CGI status as probability scores. This provides flexibility in the definition of a CGI and facilitates the creation of CGI lists for other species. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by generating the first CGI lists for invertebrates, and the fact that we can cre-ate CGI lists that substantially increases overlap with recently discovered epigenetic marks. A CGI list and the probability scores, as a function of genome location, for each species are available at http://www .rafalab.org.},

In the past few years, biochemical and structural studies have revealed mechanistic insights into how TET and TDG mediate active DNA demethylation. Additionally, many regulatory mechanisms of this process have been identified. Technological advances in mapping and tracing the oxidized forms of 5mC allow further dissection of their functions. Furthermore, the biological functions of active DNA demethylation in various biological contexts have also been revealed.

It is thought that these are formed by cohesin complexes via extrusion, either until loop expansion is arrested by CTCF or until cohesin is removed from DNA by WAPL. Although WAPL limits cohesin's chromatin residence time to minutes, it has been reported that some loops exist for hours. How these loops can persist is unknown. We show that during G1-phase, mammalian cells contain acetylated cohesinSTAG1 which binds chromatin for hours, whereas cohesinSTAG2 binds chromatin for minutes. Our results indicate that CTCF and the acetyltransferase ESCO1 protect a subset of cohesinSTAG1 complexes from WAPL, thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops, and that ESCO1, like CTCF, contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping. Our data are consistent with a model of nested loop extrusion, in which acetylated cohesinSTAG1 forms stable loops between CTCF sites, demarcating the boundaries of more transient cohesinSTAG2 extrusion activity.},

  abstract = {Animal genomes are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than two-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by ten-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between enhancer-promoter contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of enhancer-promoter biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries.

  abstract = {Genomic DNA methylation contributes substantively to transcriptional regulations that underlie mammalian development and cellular differentiation. Much effort has been made to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns. However, little is known about genome-wide variation of DNA methylation patterns. In this study, we introduced the concept of methylation entropy, a measure of the randomness of DNA methylation patterns in a cell population, and exploited it to assess the variability in DNA methylation patterns of Alu repeats and promoters. A few interesting observations were made: (i) within a cell population, methylation entropy varies among genomic loci; (ii) among cell populations, the methylation entropies of most genomic loci remain constant; (iii) compared to normal tissue controls, some tumors exhibit greater methylation entropies; (iv) Alu elements with high methylation entropy are associated with high GC content but depletion of CpG dinucleotides and (v) Alu elements in the intronic regions or far from CpG islands are associated with low methylation entropy. We further identified 12 putative allelic-specific methylated genomic loci, including four Alu elements and eight promoters. Lastly, using subcloned normal fibroblast cells, we demonstrated the highly variable methylation patterns are resulted from low fidelity of DNA methylation inheritance.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background             3D genome structure contributes to the establishment or maintenance of cell identity in part by organizing genes into spatial active or inactive compartments. Less is known about how compartment switching occurs across different cell types. Rather than analyze individual A/B compartment switches between pairs of cell types, here, we seek to identify coordinated changes in groups of compartment-scale interactions across a spectrum of cell types.                                   Results             To characterize the impact of genome folding on cell identity, we integrated 35 Hi-C datasets with 125 DNase-seq, 244 RNA-seq, and 893 ChIP-seq datasets. We first find physical associations with the nuclear lamina inform the most dramatic changes in chromosome structure across cell types. By examining variations in chromosome structure, transcription, and chromatin accessibility, we further observe that certain sets of correlated chromosome structure contacts also co-vary in transcription and chromatin accessibility. Analyzing ChIP-seq signals, we find that sets of chromosome contacts that form and break in sync tend to share active or suppressive histone marks. Finally, we observe that similar principles appear to govern chromosome structure fluctuations across single cells as were found across cell types.                                   Conclusion             Our results suggest that cells adapt their chromosome structures, guided by variable associations with the lamina and histone marks, to allocate up-regulatory or down-regulatory resources to certain regions and achieve transcription and chromatin accessibility variation. Our study shows E-PCA can identify the major variable interaction sets within populations of single cells, across broad categories of normal cell types, and between cancer and non-cancerous cell types.},

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), silences gene expression via its histone methyltransferase activity. We found that the oncogenic function of EZH2 in cells of castration-resistant prostate cancer is independent of its role as a transcriptional repressor. Instead, it involves the ability of EZH2 to act as a coactivator for critical transcription factors including the androgen receptor. This functional switch is dependent on phosphorylation of EZH2 and requires an intact methyltransferase domain. Hence, targeting the non-PRC2 function of EZH2 may have therapeutic efficacy for treating metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we demonstrate that 2-HG is a competitive inhibitor of multiple {$\alpha$}-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methlycytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. 2-HG occupies the same space as {$\alpha$}-KG does in the active site of histone demethylases. Ectopic expression of tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants inhibits histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. In glioma, IDH1 mutations are associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC). Hence, tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduce {$\alpha$}-KG and accumulate an {$\alpha$}-KG antagonist, 2-HG, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations.},

In particular, there are no existing phylogenetic-model-based methods to analyze chromatin interactions as continuous features. Here, we develop phylogenetic hidden Markov random field (Phylo-HMRF) to identify evolutionary patterns of 3D genome based on multi-species Hi-C data by jointly utilizing spatial constraints among genomic loci and continuous-trait evolutionary models. We used Phylo-HMRF to uncover cross-species 3D genome patterns based on Hi-C data from the same cell type in four primate species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla). The identified evolutionary patterns of 3D genome correlate with features of genome structure and function. This work provides a new framework to analyze multi-species continuous genomic features with spatial constraints and has the potential to help reveal the evolutionary principles of 3D genome organization.},

Method Hypoxia genes were identified in vitro via RNA-sequencing and combined with in vivo gene co-expression analysis to generate a signature. The signature was independently validated in eleven prostate cancer cohorts and a bladder cancer phase III randomized trial of radiotherapy alone or with carbogen and nicotinamide (CON). Results A 28-gene signature was derived. Patients with high signature scores had poorer biochemical recurrence free survivals in six of eight independent cohorts of prostatectomy-treated patients (Log rank test P {$<$} .05), with borderline significances achieved in the other two (P {$<$} .1). The signature also predicted biochemical recurrence in patients receiving post-prostatectomy radiotherapy (n = 130, P = .007) or definitive radiotherapy alone (n = 248, P = .035). Lastly, the signature predicted metastasis events in a pooled cohort (n = 631, P = .002). Prognostic significance remained after adjusting for clinic-pathological factors and commercially available prognostic signatures. The signature predicted benefit from hypoxia-modifying therapy in bladder cancer patients (intervention-by-signature interaction test P = .0026), where carbogen and nicotinamide was associated with improved survival only in hypoxic tumours. Conclusion A 28-gene hypoxia signature has strong and independent prognostic value for prostate cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions. However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control. The freely available R package HiCRep implements our approach.},

Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which is common in breast cancer, may be a key mechanism leading to the tumor progression. In this study, we studied whether a quantitative genetic definition of ITH can predict clinical outcomes in patients with TNBC. We quantified ITH by calculating Shannon index, a measure of diversity in a population, based on Myc, epidermal growth factor receptor/centromeric probe 7 (EGFR/CEP7) and cyclin D1/centromeric probe 11 (CCND1/CEP11) copy number variations (CNVs) in 300 cells at three different locations of a tumor. Among 75 TNBC patients, those who developed metastasis had significantly higher ITH, that is Shannon indices of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs. Higher Shannon indices of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs were significantly associated with the development of metastasis and were predictive of significantly worse metastasis-free survival (MFS). Regional heterogeneity, defined as the difference in copy numbers of Myc, EGFR or CCND1 at different locations, was found in 52 patients. However, the presence of regional heterogeneity did not correlate with metastasis or MFS. Our findings demonstrate that higher ITH of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs is predictive of metastasis and is associated with significantly worse MFS in TNBC patients, suggesting that ITH is a very promising novel prognostic factor in TNBC.},

The human DNA MTase cDNA has eighty percent homology at the nucleotide level, and the predicted protein has seventy-four percent identity at the amino acid level, to the DNA MTase cDNA cloned from mouse cells. Like the murine DNA MTase, the amino terminal two-thirds of the human protein contains a cysteine-rich region suggestive of a metal-binding domain. The carboxy terminal one-third of the protein shows considerable similarity to prokaryotic (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases. The arrangement of multiple motifs conserved in the prokaryotic genes is preserved in the human DNA MTase, including the relative position of a proline-cysteine dipeptide thought to be an essential catalytic site in all (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases. A single 5.2 kb transcript was detected in all human tissues tested, with the highest levels of expression observed in RNA from placenta, brain, heart and lung. DNA MTase cDNA clones were used to screen a chromosome 19 genomic cosmid library. The DNA MTase-positive cosmids which are estimated to span a genomic distance of 93 kb have been localized to 19p13.2-p13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Isolation of the cDNA for human DNA MTase will allow further study of the regulation of DNA MTase expression, and of the role of this enzyme in establishing DNA methylation patterns in both normal and neoplastic cells.},

Whole exome sequencing was performed in available bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis (n\,=\,10), remission (n\,=\,6), and first relapse (n\,=\,10). A total of 41 driver mutations were identified, of which 11 were primary tumor-specific, 17 relapse-specific, and 13 shared (detected both in primary and relapsed tumor samples). We demonstrated that 12 of 13 shared mutations were in epigenetic modifier and spliceosome genes. Longitudinal genomic characterization revealed that in eight of 10 patients the founder leukemic clone persisted after chemotherapy and established the basis of relapse years later. Understanding the mechanisms of such quiescence in leukemic cells may help designing future strategies aimed at increasing remission duration in patients with AML.},

By analysis of 542 human TFs with methylation- sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), we found that there are also many TFs that prefer CpG-methylated sequences. Most of these are in the extended homeodomain family. Structural analysis showed that homeodomain specificity for methylcytosine depends on direct hydrophobic interactions with the methylcytosine 5-methyl group. This study provides a systematic examination of the effect of an epigenetic DNA modification on human TF binding specificity and reveals that many developmentally important proteins display preference for mCpG-containing sequences.},

  abstract = {Accumulation and selection of somatic mutations in a Darwinian framework result in intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) that poses significant challenges to the diagnosis and clinical therapy of cancer. Identification of the tumor cell populations (clones) and reconstruction of their evolutionary relationship can elucidate this heterogeneity. Recently developed single-cell DNA sequencing (SCS) technologies promise to resolve ITH to a single-cell level. However, technical errors in SCS data sets, including false-positives (FP) and false-negatives (FN) due to allelic dropout, and cell doublets, significantly complicate these tasks. Here, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian method that reconstructs the clonal populations as clusters of single cells, genotypes of each clone, and the evolutionary relationship between the clones. It employs a tree-structured Chinese restaurant process as the prior on the number and composition of clonal populations. The evolution of the clonal populations is modeled by a clonal phylogeny and a finite-site model of evolution to account for potential mutation recurrence and losses. We probabilistically account for FP and FN errors, and cell doublets are modeled by employing a Beta-binomial distribution. We develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm comprising partial reversible-jump and partial Metropolis-Hastings updates to explore the joint posterior space of all parameters. The performance of our method on synthetic and experimental data sets suggests that joint reconstruction of tumor clones and clonal phylogeny under a finite-site model of evolution leads to more accurate inferences. Our method is the first to enable this joint reconstruction in a fully Bayesian framework, thus providing measures of support of the inferences it makes.},

Using the Illumina MethylationEPIC [850K] BeadArray, DNA methylation was profiled in paired whole blood samples collected approximately 1 year apart from 35 healthy women enrolled in the Nurses Study II cohort. The median intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) across all CpG loci was 0.19 [Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.00\textendash 0.50]; 74.8\% of ICCs were in the low range (0\textendash 0.5), 16.9\% in the mid-range of ICCs (0.5\textendash 0.8), and 8.3\% in the high-range of ICCs (0.8\textendash 1). ICCs were similar for CpG probes on the 450K Illumina array (median 0.17) and the new probes added to the 850K array (median 0.21). ICCs for CpG loci on the sex chromosomes and known metastable epialleles were high (median 0.71, 0.97, respectively), and ICCs among methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) CpGs were significantly higher as compared to non-mQTL CpGs (median 0.73, 0.16, respectively, P {$<$} 2 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 16). We observed wide variation in DNA methylation stability over a 1-year period. Probes considered non-stable, due to substantial variation over a moderate period of time and with minimal variability across individuals could be removed in large epidemiological studies. Moreover, adjusting for technical variation that arises from using high-dimensional arrays is critical.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease in which both genetic defects and microenvironmental components contribute to the development, progression, and metastasization of disease, representing major hurdles in the identification of more effective and safer treatment regimens for patients. Three-dimensional (3D) models are changing the paradigm of preclinical cancer research as they more closely resemble the complex tissue environment and architecture found in clinical tumors than in bidimensional (2D) cell cultures. Among 3D models, spheroids and organoids represent the most versatile and promising models in that they are capable of recapitulating the heterogeneity and pathophysiology of human cancers and of filling the gap between conventional 2D in vitro testing and animal models. Such 3D systems represent a powerful tool for studying cancer biology, enabling us to model the dynamic evolution of neoplastic disease from the early stages to metastatic dissemination and the interactions with the microenvironment. Spheroids and organoids have recently been used in the field of drug discovery and personalized medicine. The combined use of 3D models could potentially improve the robustness and reliability of preclinical research data, reducing the need for animal testing and favoring their transition to clinical practice. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the use of these 3D systems for cancer modeling, focusing on their innovative translational applications, looking at future challenges, and comparing them with most widely used animal models.},

Here, by combining chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP\textendash seq), 3D DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D DNA FISH) and polymer simulations, we show that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is essential for de novo 3D genome organization during               Drosophila               early development. The binding of HP1a at pericentromeric heterochromatin is required to establish clustering of pericentromeric regions. Moreover, HP1a binding within chromosome arms is responsible for overall chromosome folding and has an important role in the formation of B-compartment regions. However, depletion of HP1a does not affect the A-compartment, which suggests that a different molecular mechanism segregates active chromosome regions. Our work identifies HP1a as an epigenetic regulator that is involved in establishing the global structure of the genome in the early embryo.},

We define such a protective role linked to DNA damage from oxidative stress (OS) known to induce this abnormality. TET2 removes aberrant DNAm during OS through interacting with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in a ``Yin-Yang'' complex targeted to chromatin and enhanced by p300 mediated TET2 acetylation. Abnormal gains of DNAm and 5hmC occur simultaneously in OS, and knocking down TET2 dynamically alters this balance by enhancing 5mC and reducing 5hmC. TET2 reduction results in hypermethylation of promoter CGIs and enhancers in loci largely overlapping with those induced by OS. Thus, TET2 indeed may protect against abnormal, cancer DNAm in a manner linked to DNA damage.},

  abstract = {Differential DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic signal for gene regulation, development, and disease processes. We mapped DNA methylation patterns of 190 gene promoter regions on chromosome 21 using bisulfite conversion and subclone sequencing in five human cell types. A total of 28,626 subclones were sequenced at high accuracy using (longread) Sanger sequencing resulting in the measurement of the DNA methylation state of 580427 CpG sites. Our results show that average DNA methylation levels are distributed bimodally with enrichment of highly methylated and unmethylated sequences, both for amplicons and individual subclones, which represent single alleles from individual cells. Within CpG-rich sequences, DNA methylation was found to be anti-correlated with CpG dinucleotide density and GC content, and methylated CpGs are more likely to be flanked by AT-rich sequences. We observed over-representation of CpG sites in distances of 9, 18, and 27 bps in highly methylated amplicons. However, DNA sequence alone is not sufficient to predict an amplicon's DNA methylation status, since 43\% of all amplicons are differentially methylated between the cell types studied here. DNA methylation in promoter regions is strongly correlated with the absence of gene expression and low levels of activating epigenetic marks like H3K4 methylation and H3K9 and K14 acetylation. Utilizing the single base pair and single allele resolution of our data, we found that i) amplicons from different parts of a CpG island frequently differ in their DNA methylation level, ii) methylation levels of individual cells in one tissue are very similar, and iii) methylation patterns follow a relaxed site-specific distribution. Furthermore, iv) we identified three cases of allele-specific DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Our data shed new light on the nature of methylation patterns in human cells, the sequence dependence of DNA methylation, and its function as epigenetic signal in gene regulation. Further, we illustrate genotype\textendash epigenotype interactions by showing novel examples of allele-specific methylation.},

We found significant heritable variation among epiRILs both in the means of several ecologically important plant traits and in their plasticities to drought and nutrients. Significant selection gradients, that is, fitness correlations, of several mean traits and plasticities suggest that selection could act on this epigenetically based phenotypic variation. Our study provides evidence that variation in DNA methylation can cause substantial heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, including root allocation, drought tolerance and nutrient plasticity, and that rapid evolution based on epigenetic variation alone should thus be possible.},

We address how a single transcription factor, forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), forms cell-specific genomic signatures and differentially regulates gene expression in four human cancer cell lines (HepG2, LNCaP, MCF7, and T47D). FOXA1 is a pioneer transcription factor in organogenesis and cancer progression. Genomewide mapping of FOXA1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing annotates that target genes associated with FOXA1 binding are mostly common to these cancer cells. However, most of the functional FOXA1 target genes are specific to each cancer cell type. Further investigations using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology indicate that cell-specific FOXA1 regulation is attributable to unique FOXA1 binding, genetic variations, and/or potential epigenetic regulation. Thus, FOXA1 controls the specificity of cancer cell types. We raise a ``flower-blooming'' hypothesis for cell-specific transcriptional regulation based on these observations.},

Interestingly, unlike previously characterized subcompartments, these interactions are present only in particular cell types, such as stem and progenitor cells.

Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have important implications for development, aging and diseases. Therefore, genome-wide mapping of DMRs across various temporal and spatial methylomes is important in revealing the impact of epigenetic modifications on heritable phenotypic variation. We present a quantitative approach, quantitative differentially methylated regions (QDMRs), to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy. QDMR was applied to synthetic methylation patterns and methylation profiles detected by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation microarray (MeDIP-chip) in human tissues/cells. This approach can give a reasonable quantitative measure of methylation difference across multiple samples. Then DMR threshold was determined from methylation probability model. Using this threshold, QDMR identified 10,651 tissue DMRs which are related to the genes enriched for cell differentiation, including 4740 DMRs not identified by the method developed by Rakyan et al. QDMR can also measure the sample specificity of each DMR. Finally, the application to methylation profiles detected by reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) in mouse showed the platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of potential functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Higher-order chromatin organization such as A/B compartments, TADs and chromatin loops are temporarily disrupted during mitosis. These structures are thought to organize aspects of gene regulation, and thus it is important to understand how they are re-established after mitosis. We examined the dynamics of chromosome reorganization by Hi-C at defined time points following exit from mitosis in highly purified, synchronous cell populations. We observed that A/B compartments are rapidly established and progressively gain in strength following mitotic exit. Contact domain formation occurs from the ``bottom-up'' with smaller sub-TADs forming initially, followed by convergence into multi-domain TAD structures. CTCF is strongly retained at a significant fraction of sites on mitotic chromosomes and immediately resumes full binding at ana/telophase, the earliest tested time point. In contrast, cohesin is completely evicted from mitotic chromosomes and resumes focal binding with delayed kinetics. The formation of CTCF/cohesin co-anchored structural loops follows the kinetics of cohesin positioning. Stripe-shaped contacts anchored by CTCF grow in length, consistent with a loop extrusion process after mitosis. Interactions between cis-regulatory elements can form rapidly, preceding CTCF/cohesin anchored structural loops. Strikingly, we identified a group of rapidly emerging transient contacts between cis-regulatory elements in ana/telophase, that are dissolved upon G1 entry, co-incident with the establishment of inner boundaries or nearby interfering loops. Our findings indicate that distinct but mutually influential forces drive post-mitotic chromatin re-configuration to shape compartments, contact domains, cis-element contacts, and CTCF/cohesin dependent loops.},

Mitotic cell division induces marked chromosome condensation, but following reentry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, chromosomes reestablish their interphase organization. Here, we tested the role of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in this transition using a cell line that allows its auxin-mediated degradation. In situ Hi-C showed that RNAPII is required for both compartment and loop establishment following mitosis. RNAPs often counteract loop extrusion, and in their absence, longer and more prominent loops arose. Evidence from chromatin binding, super-resolution imaging, and in silico modeling allude to these effects being a result of RNAPII-mediated cohesin loading upon G1 reentry. Our findings reconcile the role of RNAPII in gene expression with that in chromatin architecture.}

Currently, the implications of tissue heterogeneity and sampling bias during diagnosis are unclear for selection and subsequent performance of potential combination therapies. Here, we apply a multiobjective computational optimization approach integrated with empirical information on efficacy and toxicity for individual drugs with respect to a spectrum of genetic perturbations, enabling derivation of optimal drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors comprising distributions of subpopulations possessing these perturbations. Analysis across probabilistic samplings from the spectrum of various possible distributions reveals that the most beneficial (considering both efficacy and toxicity) set of drugs changes as the complexity of genetic heterogeneity increases. Importantly, a significant likelihood arises that a drug selected as the most beneficial single agent with respect to the predominant subpopulation in fact does not reside within the most broadly useful drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors. The underlying explanation appears to be that heterogeneity essentially homogenizes the benefit of drug combinations, reducing the special advantage of a particular drug on a specific subpopulation. Thus, this study underscores the importance of considering heterogeneity in choosing drug combinations and offers a principled approach toward designing the most likely beneficial set, even if the subpopulation distribution is not precisely known.},

Such a `language' of chromatin modification constitutes a fundamental means of gene and (epi)genome regulation, underlying a myriad of cellular and developmental processes. In recent years, mounting evidence has demonstrated that miswriting, misreading or mis-erasing of the modification language embedded in chromatin represents a common, sometimes early and pivotal, event across a wide range of human cancers, contributing to oncogenesis through the induction of epigenetic, transcriptomic and phenotypic alterations. It is increasingly clear that cancer-related metabolic perturbations and oncohistone mutations also directly impact chromatin modification, thereby promoting cancerous transformation. Phase separation-based deregulation of chromatin modulators and chromatin structure is also emerging to be an important underpinning of tumorigenesis. Understanding the various molecular pathways that underscore a misregulated chromatin language in cancer, together with discovery and development of more effective drugs to target these chromatin-related vulnerabilities, will enhance treatment of human malignancies.},

Averaging methyla-tion across RE in genome is widely used to quantify global methylation. However, methylation may vary in specific RE and play diverse roles in disease devel-opment, thus averaging methylation across RE may lose significant biological information. The ambigu-ous mapping of short reads by and high cost of cur-rent bisulfite sequencing platforms make them im-practical for quantifying locus-specific RE methyla-tion. Although microarray-based approaches (partic-ularly Illumina's Infinium methylation arrays) provide cost-effective and robust genome-wide methylation quantification, the number of interrogated CpGs in RE remains limited. We report a random forest-based algorithm (and corresponding R package, REMP) that can accurately predict genome-wide locus-specific RE methylation based on Infinium array profiling data. We validated its prediction performance using alternative sequencing and microarray data.

Removing duplicate reads assumes that polymerase chain reaction amplification from library constructions is the primary source. The alternative-sampling coincidence from DNA fragmentation-has not been systematically investigated.Results: With sufficiently high-sequencing depth, sampling-induced read duplication is non-negligible, and removing duplicate reads can overcorrect read counts, causing systemic biases in variant allele fraction and copy number variation estimations. Minimal overcorrection occurs when duplicate reads are identified accounting for their mate reads, inserts are of a variety of lengths and samples are sequenced in separate batches. We investigate sampling-induced read duplication in deep sequencing data with 500\texttimes{} to 2000\texttimes{} duplicates-removed sequence coverage. We provide a quantitative solution to overcorrection and guidance for effective designs of deep sequencing platforms that facilitate accurate estimation of variant allele fraction and copy number variation.Availability and implementation: A Python implementation is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/wanding/duprecover/overview.Contact: wzhou1@mdanderson.org, kchen3@mdanderson.org SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

An important emerging area relates to the pack-aging of DNA into chromatin and, specifically, how cell type-specific chromatin organization enables differen-tial access to and activity of regulatory elements and the manifestation of unique cellular phenotypes. Eukaryotic chromatin structure can be viewed as a series of superimposed organizational layers 1,2 (FIG. 1). At the root are the DNA sequence and its direct chemi-cal modification by cytosine methylation 3 . The DNA is folded into nucleosomes \textemdash{} the fundamental units of chromatin \textemdash{} that comprise approximately 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The nucleo-somal histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 can be chemically modified and exchanged with variants. The nucleosome positions along with histone variants and modifications make up the primary structure of chromatin. Finally, three-dimensional models of chromatin in nuclei are now being developed with increasing precision and propose that there are additional sophisticated layers of genome regulation through higher-order organization and nuclear compartmentalization. With increasing knowledge of chromatin structure and its attributes at different genomic loci and in vari-ous cell types comes the challenge to elucidate which ele-ments and regulatory processes determine this structure. Specific chromatin configurations may be dictated by DNA sequence, DNA methylation patterns, transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, and transcriptional activity, and may be maintained through epigenetic controls that are rooted in the chromatin machinery},

We profiled 39 diverse primary tumors and 8 matched adjacent tissues using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and analyzed them alongside 343 additional human and 206 mouse WGBS datasets. We identified a local CpG sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in PMDs. Analysis of CpGs in this context (`solo-WCGWs') identified previously undetected PMD hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. PMD hypomethylation increased with age, beginning during fetal development, and appeared to track the accumulation of cell divisions. In cancer, PMD hypomethylation depth correlated with somatic mutation density and cell cycle gene expression, consistent with its reflection of mitotic history and suggesting its application as a mitotic clock. We propose that late replication leads to lifelong progressive methylation loss, which acts as a biomarker for cellular aging and which may contribute to oncogenesis.},

Single-cell analysis of genome architecture has been achieved using imaging and chromatin conformation capture methods such as Hi-C. To study variation in chromosome structure between different cell types, computational approaches are needed that can utilize sparse and heterogeneous single-cell Hi-C data. However, few methods exist that are able to accurately and efficiently cluster such data into constituent cell types. Here, we describe HiCluster, a single-cell clustering algorithm for Hi-C contact matrices that is based on imputations using linear convolution and random walk. Using both simulated and real data as benchmarks, HiCluster significantly improves clustering accuracy when applied to low coverage Hi-C datasets compared to existing methods. After imputation by HiCluster, structures similar to topologically associating domains (TADs) could be identified within single cells, and their consensus boundaries among cells were enriched at the TAD boundaries observed in bulk samples. In summary, HiCluster facilitates visualization and comparison of single-cell 3D genomes.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Availability{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}https://github.com/zhoujt1994/HiCluster.git{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we aim to advance strategies for accurate and efficient WGBS for application in future large-scale epidemiological studies. We systematically compared the performance of three WGBS library preparation methods with low DNA input requirement (Swift Biosciences Accel-NGS, Illumina TruSeq and QIAGEN QIAseq) on two state-of-the-art sequencing platforms (Illumina NovaSeq and HiSeq X), and also assessed concordance between data generated by WGBS and methylation arrays. Swift achieved the highest proportion of CpG sites assayed and effective coverage at 26x\,(P\,{$<$}\,0.001). TruSeq suffered from the highest proportion of PCR duplicates, while QIAseq failed to deliver across all quality metrics. There was little difference in performance between NovaSeq and HiSeq X, with the exception of higher read duplication rate on the NovaSeq (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), likely attributable to the higher cluster densities on its flow cells. Systematic biases exist between WGBS and methylation arrays, with lower precision observed for WGBS across the range of depths investigated. To achieve a level of precision broadly comparable to the methylation array, a minimum coverage of 100x is recommended.},

Here we performed single-cell DNA methylome sequencing for human preimplantation embryos and found that tens of thousands of genomic loci exhibited de novo DNA methylation. This finding indicates that genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming during preimplantation development is a dynamic balance between strong global demethylation and drastic focused remethylation. Furthermore, demethylation of the paternal genome is much faster and thorough than that of the maternal genome. From the two-cell to the postimplantation stage, methylation of the paternal genome is consistently lower than that of the maternal genome. We also show that the genetic lineage of early blastomeres can be traced by DNA methylation analysis. Our work paves the way for deciphering the secrets of DNA methylation reprogramming in early human embryos.},

However, evidence is emerging to suggest that transcription factors lacking a MBD can also interact with methylated DNA. The identification of these proteins and the elucidation of their characteristics and the biological consequences of methylation-dependent transcription factor-DNA interactions are important stepping stones towards a mechanistic understanding of methylation-mediated biological processes, which have crucial implications for human development and disease.},

Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80\% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8\% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80\% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.},

Current solutions require actual or estimated cell-type composition\textemdash information not easily obtainable for many samples of interest. We propose a method, FaST-LMM-EWASher, that automatically corrects for cell-type composition without the need for explicit knowledge of it, and then validate our method by comparison with the state-of-the-art approach.

The reliability and reproducibility of these findings are intrinsically related with the correct identification of these domains from high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments.},

  abstract = {We present an approach to estimating the nature of the Waddington (or epigenetic) landscape that underlies a population of individual cells. Through exploiting high resolution single cell transcription experiments we show that cells can be located on a landscape that reflects their differentiated nature. Our approach makes use of probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction that respects the topology of our estimated epigenetic landscape. In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as "manifold", outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape. Hereby, the novelty of our approach lies in the correction of distances before extracting ordering information. This gives the advantage over other attempts, which have to correct for extracted time lines by post processing or additional data.},
